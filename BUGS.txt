1. Long lines don't horizontal scroll with character addition. Seems to be an
artifact of LineNumberText.pm.

2. Word Frequency: Counts are off; seems to be single letters
preceding/following punctuation, e.g., 's .o etc.

3. Jeebies popup: No arrow scrolling. Enter on higlighted line does not
jump to text. Focus is in text window.

4. Gutcheck popup: similar jeebies behaviour.

5. Spell popup. Gets weird with unicode.

 Bookmark doesn't work. Setting bookmark clears the wordlist.

6. .bin file saved in Unix lf on Windows. Should be OS specific cr/lf Win;
lf Unix.

7. Command line "perl gutthing file.txt" is broken.

8. Brief flash of line number widget at app startup.

9. <tb> seen as unbalanced markup.

10. WF spellcheck. Some words listed as 0 occurence.
