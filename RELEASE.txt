This is a major release. New features include running all checks on HTML document in one click (W3C
validation, CSS validation, link checking, unused CSS, image checking). There is an 
an option for side by side viewing of text and images (without having to click on "See Image" for each page).  

There is now a feature to page through a file viewing text and image side by side, using the 
user's preferred image viewer. 

There are now buttons to status bar for "Previous Image" and "Next Image" which moves the view of the text  
to the previous (next) page and shows the image for that page using the external image viewer. 
This works best if the window for the viewer is sized to match the image 
(in XnView, choose View, Auto Image Size, Fit Image to Window) and only one instance of the viewer 
is allowed to avoid one instance per page (in XnView, choose Tools, Options, General, Only One Instance).
