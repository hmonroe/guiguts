This provides instructions for release a new guiguts file on sourceforge
including creating the Windows .exe file.

First, create a Windows .exe file (these instructions have been tested
with Active State perl):

1. If your perl is installed in c:\perl, rename the directory to say
c:\perlxx to users with their own perl installation will not have an issue and change
your environment variable for the PATH to match. Look for the line
'use lib "c:/dp/dp/lib"' in guiguts.pl and make sure it matches the location
of your guiguts source; 

2. Put the three files from the following in c:\perlxx\bin: 
   http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe

3. Run "cpanp" and then "i PAR::Packer"

4. Install MinGW compiler if not already installed for instance from here: 
   https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780

5. Run "tkpp" with source "guiguts.pl", output WinGuts.exe (keep that format), 
   choose "execute + static" and "GUI", with icon gg.ico (enter the full path manually). 
   Rename setting.rc temporarily so your settings are not included in the distribution.
   
Second, to create the zip file, be certain to use the format guiguts-1.0.0.zip (numbers may vary)
in order for the update mechanism to work correctly. Do not include settings.rc or header.txt
as these may have been modified by the user and will be created if they do not exist.

Third, login to source forge using a user ID with project Admin privileges. Choose
'Project Admin', 'Features', 'Manage' on the File Manager line, add folder guiguts-1.0.0
(whatever the numbers for your version), and upload guiguts-1.0.0.zip and README.TXT (after
updating release notes in README.TXT). Click on the "i" on the line for 
guiguts-1.0.0.zip and specify for which operating systems it is the default. This will
be "Select All" or if someone has package a Mac executable version macguts-1.0.0.zip,
then choose OSX for that one.
