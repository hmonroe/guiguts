This provides instructions for creating a .zip file with
source only for uploading to sourceforge and also for creating a Windows .exe.

To create the zip file, be certain to use the format guiguts-1.0.0 (numbers may vary)
in order for the update mechanism to work correctly. Do not include settings.rc or header.txt
as these may have been modified by the user and will be created if they do not exist.

To create a Windows .exe file

1. Install ActiveState Perl

2. Put the three files from the following in c:\perl\bin: 
   http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe

3. Run "cpanp" and then "i PAR::Packer"

4. Install MinGW compiler if not already installed for instance from here: 
   https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780

5. Run "tkpp" with source "guiguts.pl", output WinGuts-1.0.0.exe (keep that format), 
   choose "execute + static" and "GUI", with icon gg.ico (enter the full path manually). 
   Rename setting.rc temporarily so your settings are not included in the distribution.
