The following bugs/feature requests have not yet been addressed (please
discuss these
[url=http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=48584]here[/url]
regarding what should be fixed to call a version 1.0):

The "Orphaned Markup" check should quit complaining about nested spans

Cannot search for asterisks. Pages in HTML skipped. 

There is no check for a footnote anchor without a footnote

Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.

I was moving around page markers. Using Move up I could move Page 3 up before 
Page 2, but then I couldn't move it back down (I think page markers aren't allowed 
to pass eachother when moving down, but apparently moving up doesn't check in the 
same way). It can of course be fixed by moving Page 2 up, and then moving Page 3 down 
first, but that's a bit clunky. 

Remove DOS Window and send errors to an error log file.

New feature requests: Selective html generation. Enhanced scannos files
to convert [oe] to ligature, [=a] to &#257. Add feature for drop caps
(would need new CSS and changes to the insert image dialog). Tool to
faciliate <ins> method to delineate the typo corrections in your HTML
versions. Adjust the pptxt check to confirm that all returns are CRLF
and not just LF. Allow highlight and copy from error check windows. New
tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given
word appear with or without hyphens). Better Index/contents/illustration
list recognizer. Convert ellipsis to real ellip or
&#8230;. File export and import that maintains information in the .bin
file.

Under the hood changes: Break up code into smaller modules with clear 
functionality and unit tests. Get winguts.exe to run all tests.
