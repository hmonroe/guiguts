The following bugs/feature requests have not yet been addressed (please
discuss these
[url=http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=48584]here[/url]
regarding what should be fixed to call a version 1.0):

Errors not yet reproduced: Cannot search for asterisks. Pages in HTML skipped. 

The "Orphaned Markup" check should quit complaining about nested spans. 
There is no check for a footnote anchor without a footnote. 
Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.
Using Move up I could move Page 3 up before 
Page 2, but then I couldn't move it back down. 

New feature requests: Selective html generation. Enhanced scannos files
to convert [oe] to ligature, [=a] to &#257. Add feature for drop caps
(would need new CSS and changes to the insert image dialog). Tool to
faciliate <ins> method to delineate the typo corrections in your HTML
versions. Adjust the pptxt check to confirm that all returns are CRLF
and not just LF. Allow highlight and copy from error check windows. New
tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given
word appear with or without hyphens). Better Index/contents/illustration
list recognizer. Convert ellipsis to real ellip or
&#8230;. File export and import that maintains information in the .bin
file. Remove DOS Window and send errors to an error log file. Do
not show multiple page numbers at a single location (or give options).

Under the hood changes: Break up code into smaller modules with clear 
functionality and unit tests. Get winguts.exe to run all tests. Get
debugger to make it through a file open (double delegation to subsubwidget
is a problem).
