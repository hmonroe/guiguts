Better HTML generation. Should be valid HTML. As a point of fact, I consider the whole autogenerate stuff a 
big bug. Not only it should be updated as all our beginning PPers use it and learn/use outdated coding, but 
should a selective html generation be included, they'll understand the whole process much better.  

Stop mangling page numbers. Adjust page markers without messing up the file. Fix bug so page numbers at beginning of a chapter comes after
the horizontal rule.  

Proofer name thing with "." or "@" in the proofer name

Clicking on Word Frequency and scanno checks should start at beginning and should only get whole words. 
Some accented Latin-1 characters prevent GG from selecting a whole word when you double-click on the word, 
and prevent the cursor from moving past it when using Ctrl+arrow key. I haven't had a chance to identify all 
of them but I know that á causes this behavior and ó doesn't. 

I would appreciate if the unicode drop down menu could be made more functional. The bottom half of the list is 
below the bottom of my screen and I can't access it. Perhaps the menu could be made to be pull-off-able so 
that I could just move it around the screen. 

If AE ligature followed by an acute accent followed by any lower case letter, after the file has been saved, 
closed, and then reopened, all of the ligature plus accent instances have converted to a Latin small letter y 
with hook (Dec 436, Hex 01B4, in the Latin Extended-B unicode set).

I would wish that there were settings in autogenerate where one could tick the tasks one wanted it to do: paragraph tags: check 
headers uncheck poetry: uncheck horizontal rulers: uncheck (except if one has a choice and if those depreciated tags have been updated) 
footnotes: check (provided the code has been updated) etc. 

Whenever I open GG, the window pops up in almost the same place as where I last left it when I closed GG, 
but not quite. (NB: I could not reproduce this problem)

Bugs already fixed: Ctrl-S does not save the file.

Create a new scannos files: "Convert [oe] to ligature and other character replacements." "What I would like to do is create an input file to automate Search and Replace. For example, here is a list of 
diacritical markup and the values to be substituted: [=a] = &#257;    [`a] = &#224;    ['a] = &#225;    
[.a] = a&#775;   [:a] = &#228;    [)a] = &#259;    [~a] = &#227;    [^a] = &#226;    [°a] = &#229; (NB: this
could be done with a new scannos list)"

Remove the deprecated tags from the html markup section. 

Replace all sometimes doesn't replace all, which is pretty annoying. When the cursor is somewhere in the middle 
of the file, only up to that point all is replaced. (NB: I could not reproduce the error) 


Add feature for drop caps (would need new CSS and changes to the insert image dialog)

For those of you who may want to use the <ins> method to delineate the typo corrections in your HTML versions, here is one way to automate the creation of those in GG: 
1. Set all of the corrections similarly to this analagous[** analogous]. 
2. For the Search parameter: (\w+)\[\*\*\s(.+)\] 
3. For the Replace parameter: <ins title='Correction: text was "$1"'>$2</ins> 
4. Finally, use Search and then, R & S for each one or if you're feeling lucky Rpl All. 
The output should say <ins title='Correction: text was "analagous"'>analogous</ins> 
Finally, to remove the <ins> markup from the TXT version: 
 Search: <ins title='Correction: was "(.+)"'>(.+)</ins> 
 Replace: $2 
   [Remember to keep the GOOD one!] 

Adjust the pptxt check to confirm that all returns are CRLF and not just LF.  

Allow highlight and copy from error check windows

Add new tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given word appear with or without hyphens);

can we make the "Orphaned Markup" check quit complaining about nested spans? Just had another new person trip over it. The oldbies know, "Oh, just ignore that." 

Index/contents/illustration list recognizer--

Return to top of file after fixup function.

Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.

Real endash/emdash

Convert ellipsis to real ellip or &#8230;

Normalize spell check encoding vis-a-vis 0.50/0.60: iso8859 for 50;
iso-8859 for 60 aspell

Clean up FIXME:'s

Rename sub's to something more logical and/or obvious, e.g., sub
text_convert_sc.

Fix all file open routines to "use FileHandle".
