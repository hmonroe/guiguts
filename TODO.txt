The following bugs/feature requests have not yet been addressed (please
discuss these
[url=http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=48584]here[/url]
regarding what should be fixed to call a version 1.0):

Generate only valid HTML. Fix bug so page numbers at
beginning of a chapter comes after the horizontal rule. 
Stop mangling page numbers. Adjust page
markers without messing up the file.  

Clicking on Word Frequency and scanno checks should start at beginning
and should only get whole words. Some accented Latin-1 characters
prevent GG from selecting a whole word when you double-click on the
word, and prevent the cursor from moving past it when using Ctrl+arrow
key. I haven't had a chance to identify all of them but I know that á
causes this behavior and ó doesn't.

Unicode drop down menu could be made more functional. The bottom half of
the list is below the bottom of my screen and I can't access it.

If AE ligature followed by an acute accent followed by any lower case
letter, after the file has been saved, closed, and then reopened, all of
the ligature plus accent instances have converted to a Latin small
letter y with hook (Dec 436, Hex 01B4, in the Latin Extended-B unicode
set).

The "Orphaned Markup" check should quit complaining about nested spans

Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.

New feature requests: Selective html generation. Enhanced scannos files
to convert [oe] to ligature, [=a] to &#257. Add feature for drop caps
(would need new CSS and changes to the insert image dialog). Tool to
faciliate <ins> method to delineate the typo corrections in your HTML
versions. Adjust the pptxt check to confirm that all returns are CRLF
and not just LF. Allow highlight and copy from error check windows. New
tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given
word appear with or without hyphens). Better Index/contents/illustration
list recognizer. Real endash/emdash. Convert ellipsis to real ellip or
&#8230;.

There are bugs I could not reproduce or do not understand: Whenever I
open GG, the window pops up in almost the same place as where I last
left it when I closed GG, but not quite. Replace all sometimes doesn't
replace all, which is pretty annoying. When the cursor is somewhere in
the middle of the file, only up to that point all is replaced.
