The following bugs/feature requests have not yet been addressed:

Deleting letters of page markers permitted. 
The "Orphaned Markup" check should quit complaining about nested spans. 
There is no check for a footnote anchor without a footnote. 
Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.
Using Move up I could move Page 3 up before 
Page 2, but then I couldn't move it back down. 

New feature requests: Export to text with page markers.
Enhanced scannos filesto convert [oe] to ligature, [=a] to &#257. 
Add feature for drop caps (would need new CSS and changes to the
insert image dialog). Adjust the pptxt check to confirm that all returns
are CRLF and not just LF. Allow highlight and copy from error check windows. 
New tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given
word appear with or without hyphens). Better Index/contents/illustration
list recognizer. Convert ellipsis to real ellip or
&#8230;. Add files to W3C to allow use of HTML11 DTD.

Single source formats: RST, PGTEI, EPPG

Under the hood changes: Break up code into smaller modules with clear 
functionality and unit tests. Get debugger to make it through a file 
open (double delegation to subsubwidget LineNumberText/TextUnicode
seems to be the problem).
