The following bugs/feature requests have not yet been addressed:

Deleting letters of page markers permitted. 
The "Orphaned Markup" check should quit complaining about nested spans. 
There is no check for a footnote anchor without a footnote. 
Fix spell check popup. Acts weird with unicode.
Using Move up I could move Page 3 up before 
Page 2, but then I couldn't move it back down. 
Report of CSS not used is inaccurate (Mother Meg).
Add files to W3C to allow use of HTML11 DTD.

New feature requests: Export to text with page markers.
Selective html generation. Enhanced scannos files
to convert [oe] to ligature, [=a] to &#257. Add feature for drop caps
(would need new CSS and changes to the insert image dialog). Adjust the 
pptxt check to confirm that all returns are CRLF
and not just LF. Allow highlight and copy from error check windows. New
tool to help in removing hyphens (for instance, how often does a given
word appear with or without hyphens). Better Index/contents/illustration
list recognizer. Convert ellipsis to real ellip or
&#8230;. Do not show multiple page numbers at a single location (or give options).

Single source formats: RST, PGTEI, EPPG

Under the hood changes: Break up code into smaller modules with clear 
functionality and unit tests. Get debugger to make it through a file 
open (double delegation to subsubwidget LineNumberText/TextUnicode
seems to be the problem).

 (?{ local $d=0 })(?:\((?{$d++})|\)(?{$d--})(?(?{$d<0})(?!))|(?> [^()]* ))*(?(?{$d!=0})(?!))
