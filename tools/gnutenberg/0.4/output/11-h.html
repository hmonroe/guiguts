        conversation?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she was
        considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
        made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
        a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking
        the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by
        her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was nothing
        so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> remarkable in that; nor did
        Alice think it so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> much out of the way to hear the
        Rabbit say to itself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh dear! Oh dear! I
        shall be late!”</span> (when she thought it over afterwards, it
        occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
        time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">took a
        watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,</span></em> and looked at it, and
        then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her
        mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
        curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
        just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
        hedge.</p><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice02.png" alt="White Rabbit checking watch." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another moment
        down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she
        was to get out again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rabbit-hole
        went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
        down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
        herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Either the well
        was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as
        she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to
        happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at
        the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
        passed; it was labelled <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Orange
        Marmalade</span></span>”</span>, but to her great disappointment it
        was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
        somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell
        past it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well!”</span> thought Alice to herself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
        tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I
        wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the
        house!”</span> (Which was very likely true.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down, down, down.
        Would the fall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">never</span></em> come to an end! <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this
        time?”</span> she said aloud. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must be
        getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that
        would be four thousand miles down, I think&nbsp;—”</span> (for, you
        see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in
        the schoolroom, and though this was not a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em> good
        opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
        listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
        <span class="tei tei-q">“— yes, that's about the right
        distance&nbsp;— but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got
        to?”</span> (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude
        either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently she
        began again. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if I shall fall right
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">through</span></em> the earth! How funny it'll
        seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads
        downward! The Antipathies, I think&nbsp;—”</span> (she was rather
        glad there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></em> no one listening, this time, as
        it didn't sound at all the right word) <span class="tei tei-q">“— but
        I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
        Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”</span> (and she
        tried to curtsey as she spoke&nbsp;— fancy <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">curtseying</span></em> as you're falling through
        the air! Do you think you could manage it?) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for
        asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
        somewhere.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down, down, down.
        There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
        should think!”</span> (Dinah was the cat.) <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear!
        I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm
        afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you
        know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?”</span> And here Alice began to
        get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
        way, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat
        bats?”</span> and sometimes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do bats eat
        cats?”</span> for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
        it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was
        dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
        hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a
        bat?”</span> when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
        of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was not a
        bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked
        up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
        passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
        There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
        was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!”</span>
        She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit
        was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,
        which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were doors
        all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been
        all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
        walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out
        again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly she came
        upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was
        nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was
        that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!
        either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any
        rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time
        round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
        behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
        little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it
        fitted!</p><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice03.png" alt=
        "Alice finding tiny door behind curtain." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice opened the
        door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than
        a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the
        loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
        hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those
        cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the
        doorway; <span class="tei tei-q">“and even if my head would go
        through,”</span> thought poor Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
        would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I
        could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how
        to begin.”</span> For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
        happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
        indeed were really impossible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There seemed to be
        no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table,
        half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book
        of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found
        a little bottle on it, (<span class="tei tei-q">“which certainly was
        not here before,”</span> said Alice,) and round the neck of the
        bottle was a paper label, with the words <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Drink me</span></span>”</span> beautifully
        printed on it in large letters.</p><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice04.png" alt="Alice taking “Drink me” bottle." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was all very
        well to say <span class="tei tei-q">“Drink me,”</span> but the wise
        little Alice was not going to do <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> in a
        hurry. <span class="tei tei-q">“No, I'll look first,”</span> she
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and see whether it's marked
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">poison</span></span>’</span> or not”</span>; for
        she had read several nice little histories about children who had got
        burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all
        because they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">would</span></em> not remember the simple rules
        their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will
        burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> deeply with a knife, it usually
        bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
        bottle marked <span class="tei tei-q">“poison,”</span> it is almost
        certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, this
        bottle was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> marked <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“poison,”</span> so Alice ventured to taste it, and
        finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
        cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
        buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style=
        "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">* * *
        * * * *<br />
        * * * * * *<br />
        * * * * * * *<br /></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What a curious feeling!”</span> said Alice; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I must be shutting up like a telescope.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so it was
        indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up
        at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the
        little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a
        few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a
        little nervous about this; <span class="tei tei-q">“for it might end,
        you know,”</span> said Alice to herself, <span class="tei tei-q">“in
        my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be
        like then?”</span> And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle
        is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
        ever having seen such a thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a while,
        finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
        garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door,
        she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went
        back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it:
        she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
        best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too
        slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor
        little thing sat down and cried.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, there's no use in crying like that!”</span> said
        Alice to herself, rather sharply; <span class="tei tei-q">“I advise
        you to leave off this minute!”</span> She generally gave herself very
        good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she
        scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once
        she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself
        in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this
        curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But it's no use now,”</span> thought poor
        Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“to pretend to be two people! Why,
        there's hardly enough of me left to make <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
        respectable person!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon her eye fell
        on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it,
        and found in it a very small cake, on which the words <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Eat me”</span> were beautifully marked in currants.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I'll eat it,”</span> said Alice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach
        the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door;
        so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which
        happens!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She ate a little
        bit, and said anxiously to herself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Which
        way? Which way?”</span>, holding her hand on the top of her head to
        feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find
        that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens
        when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of
        expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed
        quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she set to
        work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just then her head
        struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than
        nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and
        hurried off to the garden door.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Alice! It was
        as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into
        the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than
        ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,”</span> said Alice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a great girl like you,”</span> (she might
        well say this), <span class="tei tei-q">“to go on crying in this way!
        Stop this moment, I tell you!”</span> But she went on all the same,
        shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round
        her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a time she
        heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily
        dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
        returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one
        hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
        hurry, muttering to himself as he came, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh!
        the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her
        waiting!”</span> Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask
        help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a
        low, timid voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you please,
        sir&nbsp;—”</span> The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
        kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
        as he could go.</p><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice took up the
        fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning
        herself all the time she went on talking: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And
        yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed
        in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
        morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
        But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?
        Ah, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that's</span></em> the great puzzle!”</span> And
        she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the
        same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm sure I'm not Ada,”</span> she said, <span class=

        doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I

        six is thirteen, and four times seven is&nbsp;— oh dear! I shall
        never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table
        doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris,
        and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome&nbsp;— no, <em class=

        hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat
        it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not
        come the same as they used to do:&nbsp;—</p>

        "tei tei-q">“I'm sure those are not the right words,”</span> said
        poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have
        to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to
        play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my
        mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use
        their putting their heads down and saying <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Come up again, dear!’</span> I shall only look up and
        say <span class="tei tei-q">‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
        then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay
        down here till I'm somebody else’</span>&nbsp;— but, oh dear!”</span>
        cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        do wish they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">would</span></em> put their heads down! I am so
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> tired of being all alone
        here!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she said this
        she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had
        put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was
        talking. <span class="tei tei-q">“How <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> I
        have done that?”</span> she thought. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must
        be growing small again.”</span> She got up and went to the table to
        measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess,
        she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly:
        she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was
        holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
        away altogether.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></em> a narrow escape!”</span> said
        Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to
        find herself still in existence; <span class="tei tei-q">“and now for
        the garden!”</span> and she ran with all speed back to the little
        door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little
        golden key was lying on the glass table as before, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and things are worse than ever,”</span> thought the poor
        child, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I never was so small as this
        before, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she said these
        words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to
        her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow
        fallen into the sea, <span class="tei tei-q">“and in that case I can
        go back by railway,”</span> she said to herself. (Alice had been to
        the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion,
        that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of
        bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with
        wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a
        railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool
        of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p><a name=
        "fig12" id="fig12"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice07.png" alt=
        "Alice swimming in the pool of tears." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wish I hadn't cried so much!”</span> said Alice, as
        she swam about, trying to find her way out. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
        drowned in my own tears! That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">will</span></em> be a queer thing, to be sure!
        However, everything is queer to-day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just then she
        heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she
        swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be
        a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was
        now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped
        in like herself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Would it be of any use, now,”</span> thought Alice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to speak to this mouse? Everything is so
        out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can
        talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.”</span> So she began:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“O Mouse, do you know the way out of this
        pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!”</span> (Alice
        thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had
        never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her
        brother's Latin Grammar, <span class="tei tei-q">“A mouse&nbsp;— of a
        mouse&nbsp;— to a mouse&nbsp;— a mouse&nbsp;— O mouse!”</span>) The
        Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink
        with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps it doesn't understand English,”</span> thought
        Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“I daresay it's a French mouse, come
        over with William the Conqueror.”</span> (For, with all her knowledge
        of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had
        happened.) So she began again: <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-q"
        xml:lang="fr">“Ou est ma chatte?”</span> which was the first sentence
        in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
        water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, I beg your pardon!”</span> cried Alice hastily,
        afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I quite forgot you didn't like cats.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not like cats!”</span> cried the Mouse, in a shrill,
        passionate voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Would <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> like
        cats if you were me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, perhaps not,”</span> said Alice in a soothing
        tone: <span class="tei tei-q">“don't be angry about it. And yet I
        wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to
        cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
        thing,”</span> Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily
        about in the pool, <span class="tei tei-q">“and she sits purring so
        nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face&nbsp;— and
        she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&nbsp;— and she's such a
        capital one for catching mice&nbsp;— oh, I beg your pardon!”</span>
        cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over,
        and she felt certain it must be really offended. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather
        not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We indeed!”</span> cried the Mouse, who was trembling
        down to the end of his tail. <span class="tei tei-q">“As if I would
        talk on such a subject! Our family always <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hated</span></em>
        cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
        again!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I won't indeed!”</span> said Alice, in a great hurry to
        change the subject of conversation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are
        you&nbsp;— are you fond&nbsp;— of&nbsp;— of dogs?”</span> The Mouse
        did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is such a nice little dog near our house I should
        like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh,
        such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw
        them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
        things&nbsp;— I can't remember half of them&nbsp;— and it belongs to
        a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred
        pounds! He says it kills all the rats and&nbsp;— oh dear!”</span>
        cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm afraid
        I've offended it again!”</span> For the Mouse was swimming away from
        her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool
        as it went.</p><a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        "Alice and the Mouse swimming in the pool of tears." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she called
        softly after it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mouse dear! Do come back
        again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like
        them!”</span> When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam
        slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice
        thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
        history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and
        dogs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was high time
        to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and
        animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory
        and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
        way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were indeed a
        queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&nbsp;— the birds with
        draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them,
        and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first question
        of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about
        this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to
        find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them
        all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory,
        who at last turned sulky, and would only say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am older than you, and must know better”</span>; and
        this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as
        the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be
        said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the Mouse,
        who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I'll</span></em> soon make you dry
        enough!”</span> They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
        Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for
        she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very
        soon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ahem!”</span> said the Mouse with an important air,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“are you all ready? This is the driest thing
        I know. Silence all round, if you please! <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ugh!”</span> said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon!”</span> said the Mouse, frowning, but
        very politely: <span class="tei tei-q">“Did you speak?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not I!”</span> said the Lory hastily.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I thought you did,”</span> said the Mouse. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">it,</span></em>”</span> the Mouse replied rather
        crossly: <span class="tei tei-q">“of course you know what
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘it’</span> means.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know what <span class="tei tei-q">‘it’</span> means
        well enough, when I find a thing,”</span> said the Duck: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what
        did the archbishop find?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mouse did not
        notice this question, but hurriedly went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘— found it advisable to go
        with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
        William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his

        it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As wet as ever,”</span> said Alice in a melancholy tone:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it doesn't seem to dry me at
        all.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In that case,”</span> said the Dodo solemnly, rising to
        its feet, <span class="tei tei-q">“I move that the meeting adjourn,
        for the immediate adoption of more energetic
        remedies&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Speak English!”</span> said the Eaglet. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and,
        what's more, I don't believe you do either!”</span> And the Eaglet
        bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered
        audibly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What I was going to say,”</span> said the Dodo in an
        offended tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“was, that the best thing to
        get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> a Caucus-race?”</span> said
        Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as
        if it thought that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">somebody</span></em> ought to speak, and no one
        else seemed inclined to say anything.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> said the Dodo, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        best way to explain it is to do it.”</span> (And, as you might like
        to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the
        Dodo managed it.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First it marked
        out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (<span class="tei tei-q">“the
        exact shape doesn't matter,”</span> it said,) and then all the party
        were placed along the course, here and there. There was no
        <span class="tei tei-q">“One, two, three, and away,”</span> but they
        began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that
        it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they
        had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the
        Dodo suddenly called out <span class="tei tei-q">“The race is
        over!”</span> and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But who has won?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This question the
        Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for
        a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position
        in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while
        the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Everybody</span></em> has won, and all must have
        prizes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But who is to give the prizes?”</span> quite a chorus of
        voices asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">she,</span></em> of course,”</span> said the
        Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once
        crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Prizes! Prizes!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice had no idea
        what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled
        out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it),
        and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all
        round.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But she must have a prize herself, you know,”</span>
        said the Mouse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course,”</span> the Dodo replied very gravely.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What else have you got in your
        pocket?”</span> he went on, turning to Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Only a thimble,”</span> said Alice sadly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hand it over here,”</span> said the Dodo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then they all
        crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the
        thimble, saying <span class="tei tei-q">“We beg your acceptance of
        this elegant thimble”</span>; and, when it had finished this short
        speech, they all cheered.</p><a name="fig16" id="fig16"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice09.png" alt="Dodo presenting thimble to Alice." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice thought the
        whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did
        not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say,
        she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
        could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next thing was
        to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the
        large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the
        small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was
        over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse
        to tell them something more.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You promised to tell me your history, you know,”</span>
        said Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“and why it is you hate&nbsp;— C
        and D,”</span> she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be
        offended again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mine is a long and a sad tale!”</span> said the Mouse,
        turning to Alice, and sighing.</p><a name="fig17" id="fig17"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice10.png" alt=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> a long tail, certainly,”</span>
        said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but why do you call it sad?”</span> And she
        kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her
        idea of the tale was something like this:&nbsp;—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are not attending!”</span> said the Mouse to Alice
        severely. <span class="tei tei-q">“What are you thinking
        of?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon,”</span> said Alice very humbly:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you had got to the fifth bend, I
        think?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em>!”</span> cried the Mouse,
        sharply and very angrily.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A knot!”</span> said Alice, always ready to make herself
        useful, and looking anxiously about her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
        do let me help to undo it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I shall do nothing of the sort,”</span> said the Mouse,
        getting up and walking away. <span class="tei tei-q">“You insult me
        by talking such nonsense!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I didn't mean it!”</span> pleaded poor Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But you're so easily offended, you
        know!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mouse only
        growled in reply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Please come back and finish your story!”</span> Alice
        called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, please do!”</span> but the Mouse only shook its
        head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What a pity it wouldn't stay!”</span> sighed the Lory,
        as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the
        opportunity of saying to her daughter <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, my
        dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em>
        temper!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold your tongue,
        Ma!”</span> said the young Crab, a little snappishly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You're enough to try the patience of an
        oyster!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!”</span> said
        Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She'd soon fetch it back!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the
        question?”</span> said the Lory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice replied
        eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for
        catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after
        the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at
        it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This speech caused
        a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off
        at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully,
        remarking, <span class="tei tei-q">“I really must be getting home;
        the night-air doesn't suit my throat!”</span> and a Canary called out
        in a trembling voice to its children, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
        away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!”</span> On
        various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
        alone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!”</span> she said to
        herself in a melancholy tone. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nobody seems
        to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!
        Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!”</span>
        And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and
        low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little
        pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
        half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back
        to finish his story.</p>

        Bill</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the White
        Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it
        went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to
        itself <span class="tei tei-q">“The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear
        paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as
        ferrets are ferrets! Where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">can</span></em> I have dropped them, I
        wonder?”</span> Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the
        fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly
        began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen&nbsp;—
        everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the
        great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished
        completely.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very soon the
        Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to
        her in an angry tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, Mary Ann, what
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">are</span></em> you doing out here? Run home
        this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick,
        now!”</span> And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at
        once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
        mistake it had made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He took me for his housemaid,”</span> she said to
        herself as she ran. <span class="tei tei-q">“How surprised he'll be
        when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and
        gloves&nbsp;— that is, if I can find them.”</span> As she said this,
        she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright
        brass plate with the name <span class="tei tei-q">“W. Rabbit”</span>
        engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs,
        in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned
        out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How queer it seems,”</span> Alice said to herself,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose
        Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!”</span> And she began
        fancying the sort of thing that would happen: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Miss Alice! Come here
        directly, and get ready for your walk!’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see that the
        mouse doesn't get out.’</span> Only I don't think,”</span> Alice went
        on, <span class="tei tei-q">“that they'd let Dinah stop in the house
        if it began ordering people about like that!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time she
        had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window,
        and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny
        white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and
        was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
        bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this
        time with the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Drink me,”</span> but
        nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">something</span></em> interesting is sure to
        happen,”</span> she said to herself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
        this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for
        really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It did so indeed,
        and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the
        bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to
        stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the
        bottle, saying to herself <span class="tei tei-q">“That's quite
        enough&nbsp;— I hope I shan't grow any more&nbsp;— As it is, I can't
        get out at the door&nbsp;— I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
        much!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alas! it was too
        late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon
        had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even
        room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow
        against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she
        went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the
        window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
        become of me?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luckily for Alice,
        the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no
        larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be
        no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no
        wonder she felt unhappy.</p><a name="fig20" id="fig20"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was much pleasanter at home,”</span> thought poor
        Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“when one wasn't always growing larger
        and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost
        wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole&nbsp;— and yet&nbsp;— and
        yet&nbsp;— it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do
        wonder what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">can</span></em> have happened to me! When I used
        to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and
        now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written
        about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one&nbsp;—
        but I'm grown up now,”</span> she added in a sorrowful tone;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“at least there's no room to grow up any more
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">here.</span></em>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But then,”</span> thought Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“shall I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">never</span></em> get any older than I am now?
        That'll be a comfort, one way&nbsp;— never to be an old woman&nbsp;—
        but then&nbsp;— always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em>!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, you foolish Alice!”</span> she answered herself.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“How can you learn lessons in here? Why,
        there's hardly room for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">you,</span></em> and no room at all for any
        lesson-books!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so she went
        on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a
        conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a
        voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!”</span> said the voice. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fetch me my gloves this moment!”</span> Then came a
        little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit
        coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house,
        quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as
        the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently the
        Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door
        opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that
        attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then I'll go round and get in at the window.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">That</span></em> you won't”</span> thought
        Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just
        under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch
        in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little
        shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she
        concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
        cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.</p><a name="fig21" id=

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came an angry
        voice&nbsp;— the Rabbit's&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">“Pat! Pat!
        Where are you?”</span> And then a voice she had never heard before,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer
        honour!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Digging for apples, indeed!”</span> said the Rabbit
        angrily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here! Come and help me out of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">this</span></em>!”</span> (Sounds of more broken
        glass.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!”</span> (He pronounced it
        <span class="tei tei-q">“arrum.”</span>)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it
        fills the whole window!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all
        that.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and
        take it away!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a long
        silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then;
        such as, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sure, I don't like it, yer honour,
        at all, at all!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Do as I tell you,
        you coward!”</span> and at last she spread out her hand again, and
        made another snatch in the air. This time there were <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>
        little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!”</span>
        thought Alice. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder what they'll do
        next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">could</span></em>! I'm sure I don't want to stay
        in here any longer!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She waited for
        some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of
        little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking
        together: she made out the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Where's
        the other ladder?&nbsp;— Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got
        the other&nbsp;— Bill! fetch it here, lad!&nbsp;— Here, put 'em up at
        this corner&nbsp;— No, tie 'em together first&nbsp;— they don't reach
        half high enough yet&nbsp;— Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be
        particular&nbsp;— Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope&nbsp;— Will the
        roof bear?&nbsp;— Mind that loose slate&nbsp;— Oh, it's coming down!
        Heads below!”</span> (a loud crash)&nbsp;— <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now, who did that?&nbsp;— It was Bill, I fancy&nbsp;—
        Who's to go down the chimney?&nbsp;— Nay, I shan't! <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></em> do
        it!&nbsp;— That I won't, then!&nbsp;— Bill's to go down&nbsp;— Here,
        Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has
        he?”</span> said Alice to herself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shy, they
        seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a
        good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">think</span></em> I
        can kick a little!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She drew her foot
        as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a
        little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and
        scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to
        herself <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Bill,”</span> she gave one
        sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first thing
        she heard was a general chorus of <span class="tei tei-q">“There goes
        Bill!”</span> then the Rabbit's voice along&nbsp;— <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Catch him, you by the hedge!”</span> then silence, and
        then another confusion of voices&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold
        up his head&nbsp;— Brandy now&nbsp;— Don't choke him&nbsp;— How was
        it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about
        it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Last came a little
        feeble, squeaking voice, (<span class="tei tei-q">“That's
        Bill,”</span> thought Alice,) <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I hardly
        know&nbsp;— No more, thank ye; I'm better now&nbsp;— but I'm a deal
        too flustered to tell you&nbsp;— all I know is, something comes at me
        like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So you did, old fellow!”</span> said the others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We must burn the house down!”</span> said the Rabbit's
        voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a dead
        silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wonder what they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">will</span></em> do next! If they had any sense,
        they'd take the roof off.”</span> After a minute or two, they began
        moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A barrowful will do, to begin with.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A barrowful of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">what</span></em>?”</span> thought Alice; but she
        had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles
        came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll put a stop to this,”</span> she said to
        herself, and shouted out, <span class="tei tei-q">“You'd better not
        do that again!”</span> which produced another dead silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice noticed with
        some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as
        they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If I eat one of these cakes,”</span> she
        thought, <span class="tei tei-q">“it's sure to make <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em>
        change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
        make me smaller, I suppose.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she swallowed
        one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking
        directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door,
        she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals
        and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the
        middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
        something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment
        she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found
        herself safe in a thick wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The first thing I've got to do,”</span> said Alice to
        herself, as she wandered about in the wood, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing
        is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the
        best plan.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It sounded an
        excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the
        only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set
        about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees,
        a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great
        hurry.</p><a name="fig23" id="fig23"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice14.png" alt="Dog looking at tiny Alice." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An enormous puppy
        was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching
        out one paw, trying to touch her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Poor
        little thing!”</span> said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried
        hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time
        at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be
        very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly knowing
        what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to
        the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet
        at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made
        believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to
        keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
        other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled
        head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking
        it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and
        expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the
        thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
        stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way
        back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a
        good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and
        its great eyes half shut.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seemed to
        Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at
        once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till
        the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!”</span> said
        Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned
        herself with one of the leaves: <span class="tei tei-q">“I should
        have liked teaching it tricks very much, if&nbsp;— if I'd only been
        the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got
        to grow up again! Let me see&nbsp;— how <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> it to
        be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but
        the great question is, what?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great question
        certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and
        the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like
        the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a
        large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself;
        and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind
        it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was
        on the top of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She stretched
        herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and
        her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was
        sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
        hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
        else.</p>

        and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the
        Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a
        languid, sleepy voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was not an
        encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I&nbsp;— I hardly know, sir, just at
        present&nbsp;— at least I know who I <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> when
        I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several
        times since then.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you mean by that?”</span> said the Caterpillar
        sternly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Explain yourself!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can't explain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">myself,</span></em> I'm afraid, sir”</span> said
        Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“because I'm not myself, you
        see.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't see,”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,”</span> Alice
        replied very politely, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I can't
        understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes
        in a day is very confusing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It isn't,”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,”</span> said
        Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“but when you have to turn into a
        chrysalis&nbsp;— you will some day, you know&nbsp;— and then after
        that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer,
        won't you?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not a bit,”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,”</span>
        said Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“all I know is, it would feel
        very queer to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">me.</span></em>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You!”</span> said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Which brought them
        back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little
        irritated at the Caterpillar's making such <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>
        short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I think, you ought to tell me who <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are,
        first.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here was another
        puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason,
        and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>
        unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come back!”</span> the Caterpillar called after her.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I've something important to say!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sounded
        promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Keep your temper,”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is that all?”</span> said Alice, swallowing down her
        anger as well as she could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice thought she
        might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after
        all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it
        puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took
        the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So you think you're changed, do you?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm afraid I am, sir,”</span> said Alice; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can't remember things as I used&nbsp;— and I don't
        keep the same size for ten minutes together!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can't remember <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        Caterpillar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This time Alice
        waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two
        the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or
        twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and
        crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, <span class=

        will make you grow shorter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of the mushroom,”</span> said the Caterpillar, just as
        if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of
        sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice remained
        looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out
        which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she
        found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched
        her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the
        edge with each hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And now which is which?”</span> she said to herself, and
        nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next
        moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her
        foot!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was a good
        deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there
        was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to
        work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so
        closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
        mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
        lefthand bit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, my head's free at last!”</span> said Alice in a
        tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she
        found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see,
        when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to
        rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below
        her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">can</span></em> all that green stuff be?”</span>
        said Alice. <span class="tei tei-q">“And where <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> my
        shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see
        you?”</span> She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result
        seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green
        leaves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As there seemed to
        be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get
        her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would
        bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just
        succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to
        dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
        of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss
        made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
        face, and was beating her violently with its wings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Serpent!”</span> screamed the Pigeon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> a serpent!”</span> said Alice
        indignantly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me alone!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Serpent, I say again!”</span> repeated the Pigeon, but
        in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit
        them!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I haven't the least idea what you're talking
        about,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and
        I've tried hedges,”</span> the Pigeon went on, without attending to
        her; <span class="tei tei-q">“but those serpents! There's no pleasing
        them!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was more and
        more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything
        more till the Pigeon had finished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the
        eggs,”</span> said the Pigeon; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I must be
        on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a wink
        of sleep these three weeks!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,”</span> said Alice,
        who was beginning to see its meaning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the
        wood,”</span> continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and just as I was thinking I should be free
        of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!
        Ugh, Serpent!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But I'm <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> a serpent, I tell you!”</span>
        said Alice. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm a&nbsp;— I'm
        a&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well! <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">What</span></em> are you?”</span> said the
        Pigeon. <span class="tei tei-q">“I can see you're trying to invent
        something!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I&nbsp;— I'm a little girl,”</span> said Alice, rather
        doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone
        through that day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A likely story indeed!”</span> said the Pigeon in a tone
        of the deepest contempt. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've seen a good
        many little girls in my time, but never <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> with
        such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
        denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted
        an egg!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">have</span></em> tasted eggs, certainly,”</span>
        said Alice, who was a very truthful child; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do,
        you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't believe it,”</span> said the Pigeon;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but if they do, why then they're a kind of
        serpent, that's all I can say.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was such a
        new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two,
        which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You're looking for eggs, I know <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> well
        enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or
        a serpent?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It matters a good deal to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">me,</span></em>”</span> said Alice hastily;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens;
        and if I was, I shouldn't want <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yours:</span></em> I don't like them
        raw.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, be off, then!”</span> said the Pigeon in a sulky
        tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down
        among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting
        entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop
        and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the
        pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully,
        nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes
        taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing
        herself down to her usual height.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was so long
        since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite
        strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began
        talking to herself, as usual. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, there's
        half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never
        sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've
        got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that
        beautiful garden&nbsp;— how <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> that to be done, I
        wonder?”</span> As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
        place, with a little house in it about four feet high. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whoever lives there,”</span> thought Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it'll never do to come upon them <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
        size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!”</span> So she
        began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
        near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches
        high.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a minute or
        two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next,
        when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood&nbsp;—
        (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
        otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
        fish)&nbsp;— and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was
        opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large
        eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair
        that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what
        it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to
        listen.</p><a name="fig33" id="fig33"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice20.png" alt="Fish and Frog servants." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Fish-Footman
        began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large
        as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn
        tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“For the Duchess. An invitation from
        the Queen to play croquet.”</span> The Frog-Footman repeated, in the
        same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“From the Queen. An invitation for the
        Duchess to play croquet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then they both
        bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice laughed so
        much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of
        their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was
        gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring
        stupidly up into the sky.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice went timidly
        up to the door, and knocked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There's no sort of use in knocking,”</span> said the
        Footman, <span class="tei tei-q">“and that for two reasons. First,
        because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly,
        because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly
        hear you.”</span> And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
        going on within&nbsp;— a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
        and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
        pieces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Please, then,”</span> said Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“how am I to get in?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There might be some sense in your knocking,”</span> the
        Footman went on without attending to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“if
        we had the door between us. For instance, if you were <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inside,</span></em>
        you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.”</span> He was
        looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice
        thought decidedly uncivil. <span class="tei tei-q">“But perhaps he
        can't help it,”</span> she said to herself; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“his eyes are so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> nearly at the top of his head.
        But at any rate he might answer questions.&nbsp;— How am I to get
        in?”</span> she repeated, aloud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I shall sit here,”</span> the Footman remarked,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“till tomorrow&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment the
        door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out,
        straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to
        pieces against one of the trees behind him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“— or next day, maybe,”</span> the Footman continued in
        the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How am I to get in?”</span> asked Alice again, in a
        louder tone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Are</span></em> you to get in at all?”</span>
        said the Footman. <span class="tei tei-q">“That's the first question,
        you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, no doubt:
        only Alice did not like to be told so. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's
        really dreadful,”</span> she muttered to herself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the way all the creatures argue. It's enough to drive
        one crazy!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Footman seemed
        to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with
        variations. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall sit here,”</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on and off, for days and
        days.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But what am I to do?”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Anything you like,”</span> said the Footman, and began
        whistling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, there's no use in talking to him,”</span> said Alice
        desperately: <span class="tei tei-q">“he's perfectly idiotic!”</span>
        And she opened the door and went in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The door led right
        into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the
        other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle,
        nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large
        cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!”</span>
        Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was
        certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
        occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
        alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
        that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
        on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</p><a name="fig34" id=

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Please would you tell me,”</span> said Alice, a little
        timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for
        her to speak first, <span class="tei tei-q">“why your cat grins like
        that?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's a Cheshire cat,”</span> said the Duchess,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and that's why. Pig!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She said the last
        word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw
        in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her,
        so she took courage, and went on again:&nbsp;—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in
        fact, I didn't know that cats <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">could</span></em> grin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They all can,”</span> said the Duchess; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and most of 'em do.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't know of any that do,”</span> Alice said very
        politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You don't know much,”</span> said the Duchess;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and that's a fact.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice did not at
        all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to
        introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to
        fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at
        once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess
        and the baby&nbsp;— the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower
        of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them
        even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
        that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or
        not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">please</span></em> mind what you're
        doing!”</span> cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of
        terror. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, there goes his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">precious</span></em>
        nose”</span>; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and
        very nearly carried it off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If everybody minded their own business,”</span> the
        Duchess said in a hoarse growl, <span class="tei tei-q">“the world
        would go round a deal faster than it does.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Which would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> be an advantage,”</span> said
        Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a
        little of her knowledge. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just think of what
        work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
        twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Talking of axes,”</span> said the Duchess, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“chop off her head!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice glanced
        rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint;
        but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be
        listening, so she went on again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Twenty-four
        hours, I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">think;</span></em> or is it twelve?
        I&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, don't bother <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">me,</span></em>”</span> said the Duchess;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I never could abide figures!”</span> And
        with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
        lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end
        of every line:</p>

        Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I must go and get ready to play croquet with
        the Queen,”</span> and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a
        frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice caught the
        baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature,
        and held out its arms and legs in all directions, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“just like a star-fish,”</span> thought Alice. The poor
        little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and
        kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that
        altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could
        do to hold it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as she had
        made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into
        a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left
        foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into
        the open air. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">If</span></em> I
        don't take this child away with me,”</span> thought Alice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they're sure to kill it in a day or two:
        wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?”</span> She said the last
        words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left
        off sneezing by this time). <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't
        grunt,”</span> said Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“that's not at all
        a proper way of expressing yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The baby grunted
        again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was
        the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>
        turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes
        were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
        like the look of the thing at all. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
        perhaps it was only sobbing,”</span> she thought, and looked into its
        eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p><a name="fig35" id=
        "fig35"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice22.png" alt="Alice holding the pig baby." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No, there were no
        tears. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you're going to turn into a pig,
        my dear,”</span> said Alice, seriously, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll
        have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!”</span> The poor little
        thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and
        they went on for some while in silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was just
        beginning to think to herself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, what am
        I to do with this creature when I get it home?”</span> when it
        grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in
        some alarm. This time there could be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em>
        mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
        felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she set the
        little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away
        quietly into the wood. <span class="tei tei-q">“If it had grown
        up,”</span> she said to herself, <span class="tei tei-q">“it would
        have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome
        pig, I think.”</span> And she began thinking over other children she
        knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“if one only knew the right way to change
        them&nbsp;—”</span> when she was a little startled by seeing the
        Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cat only
        grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still
        it had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> long claws and a great many
        teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cheshire Puss,”</span> she began, rather timidly, as she
        did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only
        grinned a little wider. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, it's pleased
        so far,”</span> thought Alice, and she went on. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from
        here?”</span></p><a name="fig36" id="fig36"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That depends a good deal on where you want to get
        to,”</span> said the Cat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't much care where&nbsp;—”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then it doesn't matter which way you go,”</span> said
        the Cat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“— so long as I get <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        explanation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, you're sure to do that,”</span> said the Cat,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“if you only walk long enough.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice felt that
        this could not be denied, so she tried another question. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What sort of people live about here?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em> direction,”</span> the Cat
        said, waving its right paw round, <span class="tei tei-q">“lives a
        Hatter: and in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em> direction,”</span> waving the
        other paw, <span class="tei tei-q">“lives a March Hare. Visit either
        you like: they're both mad.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But I don't want to go among mad people,”</span> Alice
        remarked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, you can't help that,”</span> said the Cat:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're
        mad.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice didn't think
        that proved it at all; however, she went on <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how do you know that you're mad?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, then,”</span> the Cat went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail
        when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when
        I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        vanished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was not much
        surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.
        While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly
        appeared again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        ask.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It turned into a pig,”</span> Alice quietly said, just
        as if it had come back in a natural way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I thought it would,”</span> said the Cat, and vanished
        again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice waited a
        little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and
        after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the
        March Hare was said to live. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've seen
        hatters before,”</span> she said to herself; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
        perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad&nbsp;— at least not so
        mad as it was in March.”</span> As she said this, she looked up, and
        there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did you say pig, or fig?”</span> said the Cat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I said pig,”</span> replied Alice; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so
        suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All right,”</span> said the Cat; and this time it
        vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending
        with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had
        gone.</p><a name="fig37" id="fig37"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,”</span>
        thought Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“but a grin without a cat!
        It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had not gone
        much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare:
        she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were
        shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large
        a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some
        more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two
        feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying
        to herself <span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose it should be raving mad
        after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter
        instead!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a table
        set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and
        the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between
        them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion,
        resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,”</span> thought
        Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“only, as it's asleep, I suppose it
        doesn't mind.”</span></p><a name="fig40" id="fig40"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The table was a
        large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of
        it: <span class="tei tei-q">“No room! No room!”</span> they cried out
        when they saw Alice coming. <span class="tei tei-q">“There's
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">plenty</span></em> of room!”</span> said Alice
        indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the
        table.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have some wine,”</span> the March Hare said in an
        encouraging tone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice looked all
        round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't see any wine,”</span> she remarked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There isn't any,”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,”</span>
        said Alice angrily.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being
        invited,”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I didn't know it was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em>
        table,”</span> said Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“it's laid for a
        great many more than three.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Your hair wants cutting,”</span> said the Hatter. He had
        been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this
        was his first speech.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You should learn not to make personal remarks,”</span>
        Alice said with some severity; <span class="tei tei-q">“it's very
        rude.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hatter opened
        his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">said</span></em> was,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why is a raven like a
        writing-desk?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, we shall have some fun now!”</span> thought Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm glad they've begun asking
        riddles.&nbsp;— I believe I can guess that,”</span> she added
        aloud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer
        to it?”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Exactly so,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you should say what you mean,”</span> the March
        Hare went on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I do,”</span> Alice hastily replied; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“at least&nbsp;— at least I mean what I say&nbsp;— that's
        the same thing, you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not the same thing a bit!”</span> said the Hatter.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You might just as well say that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I see what I eat’</span> is the same thing as
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘I eat what I
        see’</span>!”</span></p><a name="fig41" id="fig41"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You might just as well say,”</span> added the March
        Hare, <span class="tei tei-q">“that <span class="tei tei-q">‘I like
        what I get’</span> is the same thing as <span class="tei tei-q">‘I
        get what I like’</span>!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You might just as well say,”</span> added the Dormouse,
        who seemed to be talking in his sleep, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘I breathe when I sleep’</span> is the same
        thing as <span class="tei tei-q">‘I sleep when I
        breathe’</span>!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> the same thing with you,”</span>
        said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat
        silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember
        about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hatter was the
        first to break the silence. <span class="tei tei-q">“What day of the
        month is it?”</span> he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his
        watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it
        every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice considered a
        little, and then said <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        fourth.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Two days wrong!”</span> sighed the Hatter. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!”</span> he
        added looking angrily at the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> butter,”</span> the March Hare
        meekly replied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,”</span>
        the Hatter grumbled: <span class="tei tei-q">“you shouldn't have put
        it in with the bread-knife.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The March Hare
        took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his
        cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing
        better to say than his first remark, <span class="tei tei-q">“It was
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">best</span></em> butter, you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice had been
        looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What a funny watch!”</span> she remarked. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what
        o'clock it is!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why should it?”</span> muttered the Hatter. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">your</span></em> watch tell you what year it
        is?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course not,”</span> Alice replied very readily:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but that's because it stays the same year
        for such a long time together.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Which is just the case with <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mine,</span></em>”</span> said the Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice felt
        dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of
        meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't quite understand you,”</span> she said, as
        politely as she could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Dormouse is asleep again,”</span> said the Hatter,
        and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dormouse shook
        its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Of course, of course; just what I was going
        to remark myself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you guessed the riddle yet?”</span> the Hatter
        said, turning to Alice again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, I give it up,”</span> Alice replied: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what's the answer?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I haven't the slightest idea,”</span> said the
        Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nor I,”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice sighed
        wearily. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think you might do something
        better with the time,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“than
        waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If you knew Time as well as I do,”</span> said the
        Hatter, <span class="tei tei-q">“you wouldn't talk about wasting
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">it.</span></em> It's <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">him.</span></em>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't know what you mean,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course you don't!”</span> the Hatter said, tossing
        his head contemptuously. <span class="tei tei-q">“I dare say you
        never even spoke to Time!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps not,”</span> Alice cautiously replied:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but I know I have to beat time when I learn
        music.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! that accounts for it,”</span> said the Hatter.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He won't stand beating. Now, if you only
        kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with
        the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning,
        just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to
        Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time
        for dinner!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I only wish it was,”</span> the March Hare said to
        itself in a whisper.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That would be grand, certainly,”</span> said Alice
        thoughtfully: <span class="tei tei-q">“but then&nbsp;— I shouldn't be
        hungry for it, you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not at first, perhaps,”</span> said the Hatter:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but you could keep it to half-past one as
        long as you liked.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is that the way <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hatter shook
        his head mournfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not I!”</span> he
        replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“We quarrelled last March&nbsp;—

        It's always six o'clock now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bright idea came
        into Alice's head. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is that the reason so
        many tea-things are put out here?”</span> she asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“it's always tea-time, and we've no time to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Exactly so,”</span> said the Hatter: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as the things get used up.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But what happens when you come to the beginning
        again?”</span> Alice ventured to ask.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Suppose we change the subject,”</span> the March Hare
        interrupted, yawning. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm getting tired of
        this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm afraid I don't know one,”</span> said Alice, rather
        alarmed at the proposal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then the Dormouse shall!”</span> they both cried.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Wake up, Dormouse!”</span> And they pinched
        it on both sides at once.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dormouse
        slowly opened his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wasn't
        asleep,”</span> he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I heard every word you fellows were saying.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell us a story!”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, please do!”</span> pleaded Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And be quick about it,”</span> added the Hatter,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“or you'll be asleep again before it's
        done.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Once upon a time there were three little
        sisters,”</span> the Dormouse began in a great hurry; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they
        lived at the bottom of a well&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What did they live on?”</span> said Alice, who always
        took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They lived on treacle,”</span> said the Dormouse, after
        thinking a minute or two.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They couldn't have done that, you know,”</span> Alice
        gently remarked; <span class="tei tei-q">“they'd have been
        ill.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So they were,”</span> said the Dormouse; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> ill.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice tried to
        fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be
        like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But why did they live at the bottom of a
        well?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take some more tea,”</span> the March Hare said to
        Alice, very earnestly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I've had nothing yet,”</span> Alice replied in an
        offended tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“so I can't take
        more.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You mean you can't take <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">less,</span></em>”</span> said the Hatter:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it's very easy to take <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> than
        nothing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nobody asked <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">your</span></em> opinion,”</span> said
        Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who's making personal remarks now?”</span> the Hatter
        asked triumphantly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice did not
        quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and
        bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her
        question. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did they live at the bottom of
        a well?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dormouse again
        took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was a treacle-well.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There's no such thing!”</span> Alice was beginning very
        angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sh! sh!”</span> and the Dormouse sulkily remarked,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If you can't be civil, you'd better finish
        the story for yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, please go on!”</span> Alice said very humbly;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I won't interrupt again. I dare say there
        may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one.</span></em>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“One, indeed!”</span> said the Dormouse indignantly.
        However, he consented to go on. <span class="tei tei-q">“And so these
        three little sisters&nbsp;— they were learning to draw, you
        know&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What did they draw?”</span> said Alice, quite forgetting
        her promise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Treacle,”</span> said the Dormouse, without considering
        at all this time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I want a clean cup,”</span> interrupted the Hatter:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“let's all move one place on.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He moved on as he
        spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the
        Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the
        March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from
        the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the
        March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice did not wish
        to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But I don't understand. Where did they draw
        the treacle from?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You can draw water out of a water-well,”</span> said the
        Hatter; <span class="tei tei-q">“so I should think you could draw
        treacle out of a treacle-well&nbsp;— eh, stupid?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in</span></em> the well,”</span> Alice said to
        the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course they were”</span>, said the Dormouse;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“— well in.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This answer so
        confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time
        without interrupting it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They were learning to draw,”</span> the Dormouse went
        on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and they drew all manner of things&nbsp;—
        everything that begins with an M&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why with an M?”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why not?”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was
        silent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dormouse had
        closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on
        being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek,
        and went on: <span class="tei tei-q">“— that begins with an M, such
        as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness&nbsp;— you
        know you say things are <span class="tei tei-q">‘much of a
        muchness’</span>&nbsp;— did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of
        a muchness?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Really, now you ask me,”</span> said Alice, very much
        confused, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't think&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you shouldn't talk,”</span> said the Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This piece of
        rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust,
        and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of
        the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back
        once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last
        time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the
        teapot.</p><a name="fig42" id="fig42"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>
        again!”</span> said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at
        in all my life!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as she said
        this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into
        it. <span class="tei tei-q">“That's very curious!”</span> she
        thought. <span class="tei tei-q">“But everything's curious today. I
        think I may as well go in at once.”</span> And in she went.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more she
        found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, I'll manage better this time,”</span>
        she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
        unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work
        nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket)
        till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little
        passage: and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">then</span></em>&nbsp;— she found herself at
        last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
        cool fountains.</p>

        stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were
        white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them

        watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them

        "font-style: italic">your</span></em> business, Two!”</span> said
        Seven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> his business!”</span> said Five,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and I'll tell him&nbsp;— it was for bringing
        the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seven flung down
        his brush, and had just begun <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, of all
        the unjust things&nbsp;—”</span> when his eye chanced to fall upon
        Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:
        the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Would you tell me,”</span> said Alice, a little timidly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“why you are painting those
        roses?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Five and Seven
        said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here
        ought to have been a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">red</span></em> rose-tree, and we put a white
        one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all
        have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our
        best, afore she comes, to&nbsp;—”</span> At this moment Five, who had
        been anxiously looking across the garden, called out <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Queen! The Queen!”</span> and the three gardeners
        instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound
        of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the
        Queen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First came ten
        soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three
        gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners:
        next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds,
        and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the
        royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
        jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
        ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and
        Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was
        talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was
        said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of
        Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and,
        last of all this grand procession, came <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the King and Queen of
        Hearts.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was rather
        doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three
        gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a
        rule at processions; <span class="tei tei-q">“and besides, what would
        be the use of a procession,”</span> thought she, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that
        they couldn't see it?”</span> So she stood still where she was, and
        waited.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
        procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at
        her, and the Queen said severely <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is
        this?”</span> She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and
        smiled in reply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Idiot!”</span> said the Queen, tossing her head
        impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What's your name, child?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,”</span> said
        Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all. I needn't
        be afraid of them!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And who are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">these</span></em>?”</span> said the Queen,
        pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree;
        for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on
        their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell
        whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of
        her own children.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How should I know?”</span> said Alice, surprised at her
        own courage. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's no business of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mine.</span></em>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen turned
        crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild
        beast, screamed <span class="tei tei-q">“Off with her head!
        Off&nbsp;—”</span></p><a name="fig46" id="fig46"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nonsense!”</span> said Alice, very loudly and decidedly,
        and the Queen was silent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King laid his
        hand upon her arm, and timidly said <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Consider, my dear: she is only a child!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen turned
        angrily away from him, and said to the Knave <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Turn them over!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Knave did so,
        very carefully, with one foot.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Get up!”</span> said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice,
        and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
        King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Leave off that!”</span> screamed the Queen. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You make me giddy.”</span> And then, turning to the
        rose-tree, she went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“What <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> you
        been doing here?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“May it please your Majesty,”</span> said Two, in a very
        humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we were trying&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I see!”</span> said the Queen, who had meanwhile been
        examining the roses. <span class="tei tei-q">“Off with their
        heads!”</span> and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers
        remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to
        Alice for protection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You shan't be beheaded!”</span> said Alice, and she put
        them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers
        wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then
        quietly marched off after the others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Are their heads off?”</span> shouted the Queen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!”</span>
        the soldiers shouted in reply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That's right!”</span> shouted the Queen. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can you play croquet?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soldiers were
        silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for
        her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes!”</span> shouted Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come on, then!”</span> roared the Queen, and Alice
        joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen
        next.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's&nbsp;— it's a very fine day!”</span> said a timid
        voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was
        peeping anxiously into her face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very,”</span> said Alice: <span class="tei tei-q">“—
        where's the Duchess?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hush! Hush!”</span> said the Rabbit in a low, hurried
        tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then
        raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
        whispered <span class="tei tei-q">“She's under sentence of
        execution.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What for?”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did you say <span class="tei tei-q">‘What a
        pity!’</span>?”</span> the Rabbit asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, I didn't,”</span> said Alice: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't think it's at all a pity. I said <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘What for?’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She boxed the Queen's ears&nbsp;—”</span> the Rabbit
        began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, hush!”</span> the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
        tone. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Queen will hear you! You see, she
        came rather late, and the Queen said&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Get to your places!”</span> shouted the Queen in a voice
        of thunder, and people began running about in all directions,
        tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a
        minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen
        such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
        furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes,
        and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their
        hands and feet, to make the arches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
        difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she
        succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
        her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had
        got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
        hedgehog a blow with its head, it <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em>
        twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled
        expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when
        she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very
        provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in
        the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a
        ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog
        to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and
        walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
        conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</p><a name=
        "fig47" id="fig47"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        "Alice trying to play croquet with flamingo and hedgehog." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The players all
        played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while,
        and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen
        was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Off with his head!”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Off with her head!”</span> about once in a minute.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice began to
        feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with
        the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and then,”</span> thought she, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of
        beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left
        alive!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was looking
        about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get
        away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the
        air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a
        minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have
        somebody to talk to.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How are you getting on?”</span> said the Cat, as soon as
        there was mouth enough for it to speak with.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice waited till
        the eyes appeared, and then nodded. <span class="tei tei-q">“It's no
        use speaking to it,”</span> she thought, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“till its ears have come, or at least one of
        them.”</span> In another minute the whole head appeared, and then
        Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game,
        feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to
        think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it
        appeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't think they play at all fairly,”</span> Alice
        began, in rather a complaining tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
        they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak&nbsp;—
        and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if
        there are, nobody attends to them&nbsp;— and you've no idea how
        confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
        arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of
        the ground&nbsp;— and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog
        just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How do you like the Queen?”</span> said the Cat in a low
        voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not at all,”</span> said Alice: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“she's so extremely&nbsp;—”</span> Just then she noticed
        that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“— likely to win, that it's hardly worth
        while finishing the game.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen smiled
        and passed on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">are</span></em> you talking to?”</span> said the
        King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great
        curiosity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's a friend of mine&nbsp;— a Cheshire Cat,”</span>
        said Alice: <span class="tei tei-q">“allow me to introduce
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't like the look of it at all,”</span> said the
        King: <span class="tei tei-q">“however, it may kiss my hand if it
        likes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'd rather not,”</span> the Cat remarked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don't be impertinent,”</span> said the King,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and don't look at me like that!”</span> He
        got behind Alice as he spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A cat may look at a king,”</span> said Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I've read that in some book, but I don't
        remember where.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, it must be removed,”</span> said the King very
        decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear! I wish you would have this cat
        removed!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen had only
        one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Off with his head!”</span> she said, without even
        looking round.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'll fetch the executioner myself,”</span> said the King
        eagerly, and he hurried off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice thought she
        might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she
        heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She
        had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed
        for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of
        things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
        whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her
        hedgehog.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hedgehog was
        engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an
        excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the
        only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other
        side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
        sort of way to fly up into a tree.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time she
        had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and
        both the hedgehogs were out of sight: <span class="tei tei-q">“but it
        doesn't matter much,”</span> thought Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as all the arches are gone from this side of the
        ground.”</span> So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might
        not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with
        her friend.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she got back
        to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd
        collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the
        executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
        while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very
        uncomfortable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment Alice
        appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question,
        and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke
        at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they
        said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The executioner's
        argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a
        body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing
        before, and he wasn't going to begin at <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> time
        of life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King's
        argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and
        that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p><a name="fig48" id="fig48"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice31.png" alt=
        "Executioner argues with King about cutting off Cheshire Cat's head." /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen's
        argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no
        time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
        remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice could think
        of nothing else to say but <span class="tei tei-q">“It belongs to the
        Duchess: you'd better ask <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">her</span></em> about it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She's in prison,”</span> the Queen said to the
        executioner: <span class="tei tei-q">“fetch her here.”</span> And the
        executioner went off like an arrow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cat's head
        began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had
        come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King
        and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the
        rest of the party went back to the game.</p>

        old thing!”</span> said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm
        affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was very
        glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself
        that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when
        they met in the kitchen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), <span class=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all.</span></em>
        Soup does very well without&nbsp;— Maybe it's always pepper that
        makes people hot-tempered,”</span> she went on, very much pleased at
        having found out a new kind of rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
        vinegar that makes them sour&nbsp;— and camomile that makes them
        bitter&nbsp;— and&nbsp;— and barley-sugar and such things that make
        children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they
        wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had quite
        forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when
        she heard her voice close to her ear. <span class="tei tei-q">“You're
        thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
        I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall
        remember it in a bit.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps it hasn't one,”</span> Alice ventured to
        remark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tut, tut, child!”</span> said the Duchess. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Everything's got a moral, if only you can find
        it.”</span> And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she
        spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice did not much
        like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> ugly; and secondly, because she
        was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,
        and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to
        be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The game's going on rather better now,”</span> she said,
        by way of keeping up the conversation a little.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“'Tis so,”</span> said the Duchess: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and the moral of that is&nbsp;— <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go
        round!’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Somebody said,”</span> Alice whispered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that it's done by everybody minding their own
        business!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,”</span> said the
        Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she
        added, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the moral of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
        is&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">‘Take care of the sense, and the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How fond she is of finding morals in things!”</span>
        Alice thought to herself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round
        your waist,”</span> the Duchess said after a pause: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of
        your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”</span></p><a name="fig51"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">He</span></em> might bite,”</span> Alice
        cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment
        tried.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very true,”</span> said the Duchess: <span class=

        is&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">‘Birds of a feather flock

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Only mustard isn't a bird,”</span> Alice remarked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Right, as usual,”</span> said the Duchess: <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's a mineral, I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course it is,”</span> said the Duchess, who seemed
        ready to agree to everything that Alice said; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“there's a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of
        that is&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">‘The more there is of mine,
        the less there is of yours.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, I know!”</span> exclaimed Alice, who had not
        attended to this last remark, <span class="tei tei-q">“it's a
        vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I quite agree with you,”</span> said the Duchess;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and the moral of that is&nbsp;— <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Be what you would seem to be’</span>&nbsp;— or if you'd
        like it put more simply&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">‘Never imagine
        yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that
        what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I think I should understand that better,”</span> Alice
        said very politely, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I had it written
        down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,”</span>
        the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than
        that,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, don't talk about trouble!”</span> said the Duchess.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I make you a present of everything I've said
        as yet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A cheap sort of present!”</span> thought Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm glad they don't give birthday presents
        like that!”</span> But she did not venture to say it out loud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thinking again?”</span> the Duchess asked, with another
        dig of her sharp little chin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I've a right to think,”</span> said Alice sharply, for
        she was beginning to feel a little worried.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Just about as much right,”</span> said the Duchess,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“as pigs have to fly; and the m—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But here, to
        Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the
        middle of her favourite word <span class="tei tei-q">“moral,”</span>
        and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked
        up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,
        frowning like a thunderstorm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A fine day, your Majesty!”</span> the Duchess began in a
        low, weak voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now, I give you fair warning,”</span> shouted the Queen,
        stamping on the ground as she spoke; <span class="tei tei-q">“either
        you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take
        your choice!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Duchess took
        her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let's go on with the game,”</span> the Queen said to
        Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly
        followed her back to the croquet-ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other guests
        had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the
        shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the
        game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost
        them their lives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the time they
        were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other
        players, and shouting <span class="tei tei-q">“Off with his
        head!”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Off with her head!”</span>
        Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who
        of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the
        end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
        players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
        under sentence of execution.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the Queen
        left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Alice. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't
        even know what a Mock Turtle is.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,”</span>
        said the Queen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never saw one, or heard of one,”</span> said
        Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come on, then,”</span> said the Queen, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and he shall tell you his history,”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they walked off
        together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company
        generally, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are all pardoned.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that's</span></em> a good thing!”</span> she
        said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of
        executions the Queen had ordered.</p><a name="fig52" id="fig52"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They very soon
        came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (<em class=

        "tei tei-q">“and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to
        hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have
        ordered”</span>; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the
        Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
        the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to
        go after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gryphon sat up
        and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of
        sight: then it chuckled. <span class="tei tei-q">“What fun!”</span>
        said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-q">“It's all her fancy, that: they never

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        here,”</span> thought Alice, as she went slowly after it:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I never was so ordered about in all my life,
        never!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not gone
        far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and
        lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice
        could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him
        deeply. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is his sorrow?”</span> she
        asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same
        words as before, <span class="tei tei-q">“It's all his fancy, that:
        he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So they went up to
        the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears,
        but said nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This here young lady,”</span> said the Gryphon,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“she wants for to know your history, she
        do.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'll tell it her,”</span> said the Mock Turtle in a
        deep, hollow tone: <span class="tei tei-q">“sit down, both of you,
        and don't speak a word till I've finished.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So they sat down,
        and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't see how he can <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">even</span></em>
        finish, if he doesn't begin.”</span> But she waited patiently.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Once,”</span> said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep
        sigh, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was a real Turtle.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words were
        followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional
        exclamation of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hjckrrh!”</span> from the
        Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was
        very nearly getting up and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thank
        you, sir, for your interesting story,”</span> but she could not help
        thinking there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></em> be more to come, so she sat
        still and said nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When we were little,”</span> the Mock Turtle went on at
        last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we went to school in the sea. The master was
        an old Turtle&nbsp;— we used to call him Tortoise&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?”</span>
        Alice asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,”</span>
        said the Mock Turtle angrily: <span class="tei tei-q">“really you are
        very dull!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a
        simple question,”</span> added the Gryphon; and then they both sat
        silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the
        earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!”</span>
        and he went on in these words:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't
        believe it&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never said I didn't!”</span> interrupted Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You did,”</span> said the Mock Turtle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hold your tongue!”</span> added the Gryphon, before
        Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We had the best of educations&nbsp;— in fact, we went to
        school every day&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I've</span></em> been to a day-school,
        too,”</span> said Alice; <span class="tei tei-q">“you needn't be so
        proud as all that.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“With extras?”</span> asked the Mock Turtle a little
        anxiously.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Alice, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
        learned French and music.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And washing?”</span> said the Mock Turtle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Certainly not!”</span> said Alice indignantly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,”</span> said
        the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ours</span></em> they had at the end of the
        bill, <span class="tei tei-q">‘French, music, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and
        washing</span></em>&nbsp;— extra.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You couldn't have wanted it much,”</span> said Alice;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“living at the bottom of the sea.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I couldn't afford to learn it.”</span> said the Mock
        Turtle with a sigh. <span class="tei tei-q">“I only took the regular
        course.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What was that?”</span> inquired Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,”</span>
        the Mock Turtle replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“and then the
        different branches of Arithmetic&nbsp;— Ambition, Distraction,
        Uglification, and Derision.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never heard of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Uglification,’</span> ”</span> Alice ventured to say.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gryphon lifted
        up both its paws in surprise. <span class="tei tei-q">“What! Never
        heard of uglifying!”</span> it exclaimed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Alice doubtfully: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it means&nbsp;— to&nbsp;— make&nbsp;— anything&nbsp;—
        prettier.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, then,”</span> the Gryphon went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if you don't know what to uglify is, you <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> a
        simpleton.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice did not feel
        encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the
        Mock Turtle, and said <span class="tei tei-q">“What else had you to
        learn?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, there was Mystery,”</span> the Mock Turtle
        replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“— Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then
        Drawling&nbsp;— the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used
        to come once a week: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></em> taught us Drawling, Stretching,
        and Fainting in Coils.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em> like?”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, I can't show it you myself,”</span> the Mock
        Turtle said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon
        never learnt it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hadn't time,”</span> said the Gryphon: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old
        crab, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></em> was.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never went to him,”</span> the Mock Turtle said with a
        sigh: <span class="tei tei-q">“he taught Laughing and Grief, they
        used to say.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So he did, so he did,”</span> said the Gryphon, sighing
        in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?”</span>
        said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ten hours the first day,”</span> said the Mock Turtle:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“nine the next, and so on.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What a curious plan!”</span> exclaimed Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That's the reason they're called lessons,”</span> the
        Gryphon remarked: <span class="tei tei-q">“because they lessen from
        day to day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was quite a
        new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made
        her next remark. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then the eleventh day must
        have been a holiday?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course it was,”</span> said the Mock Turtle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how did you manage on the twelfth?”</span> Alice
        went on eagerly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That's enough about lessons,”</span> the Gryphon
        interrupted in a very decided tone: <span class="tei tei-q">“tell her
        something about the games now.”</span></p>

        sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He
        looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs
        choked his voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Same as if he had a bone

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don't know where Dinn may be,”</span> said the Mock

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I believe so,”</span> Alice replied thoughtfully.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They have their tails in their mouths&nbsp;—
        and they're all over crumbs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        sea. But they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        and the reason is&nbsp;—”</span> here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut
        his eyes.&nbsp;— <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell her about the reason
        and all that,”</span> he said to the Gryphon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The reason is,”</span> said the Gryphon, <span class=

        "font-style: italic">would</span></em> go with the lobsters to the
        dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way.
        So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
        them out again. That's all.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thank you,”</span> said Alice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a
        whiting before.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can tell you more than that, if you like,”</span> said
        the Gryphon. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know why it's called a
        whiting?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never thought about it,”</span> said Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span></p>

        the Gryphon replied very solemnly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice was
        thoroughly puzzled. <span class="tei tei-q">“Does the boots and
        shoes!”</span> she repeated in a wondering tone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why, what are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        the Gryphon. <span class="tei tei-q">“I mean, what makes them so
        shiny?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice looked down
        at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They're done with blacking, I
        believe.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Now you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what are they made of?”</span> Alice asked in a tone
        of great curiosity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Soles and eels, of course,”</span> the Gryphon replied
        rather impatiently: <span class="tei tei-q">“any shrimp could have
        told you that.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If I'd been the whiting,”</span> said Alice, whose
        thoughts were still running on the song, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'd
        have said to the porpoise, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Keep back,
        please: we don't want <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">you</span></em> with us!’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They were obliged to have him with them,”</span> the
        Mock Turtle said: <span class="tei tei-q">“no wise fish would go
        anywhere without a porpoise.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wouldn't it really?”</span> said Alice in a tone of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course not,”</span> said the Mock Turtle:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“why, if a fish came to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></em>, and
        told me he was going a journey, I should say <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘With what porpoise?’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don't you mean <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘purpose’</span>?”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I mean what I say,”</span> the Mock Turtle replied in an
        offended tone. And the Gryphon added <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,
        let's hear some of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">your</span></em> adventures.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I could tell you my adventures&nbsp;— beginning from
        this morning,”</span> said Alice a little timidly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a
        different person then.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Explain all that,”</span> said the Mock Turtle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, no! The adventures first,”</span> said the Gryphon
        in an impatient tone: <span class="tei tei-q">“explanations take such
        a dreadful time.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Alice began
        telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the
        White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the
        two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their
        eyes and mouths so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></em> wide, but she gained courage as
        she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the
        part about her repeating <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-title"><span style="font-style: italic">You are Old, Father
        William,</span></span>”</span> to the Caterpillar, and the words all
        coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and
        said <span class="tei tei-q">“That's very curious.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's all about as curious as it can be,”</span> said the
        Gryphon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It all came different!”</span> the Mock Turtle repeated
        thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to hear her try
        and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.”</span> He looked at the
        Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over
        Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great
        crowd assembled about them&nbsp;— all sorts of little birds and
        beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing
        before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and
        near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a
        scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was
        a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice had never
        been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in
        books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of
        nearly everything there. <span class="tei tei-q">“That's the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The judge, by the
        way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at
        the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look
        at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.</p>

        obliged to say <span class="tei tei-q">“creatures,”</span> you see,
        because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I suppose they are the jurors.”</span> She said this
        last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
        it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of
        her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“jury-men”</span> would have done just as well.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The twelve jurors
        were all writing very busily on slates. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        are they doing?”</span> Alice whispered to the Gryphon. <span class=

        trial's begun.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        forget them before the end of the trial.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence in the court!”</span> and the King
        put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was
        talking.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice could see,
        as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the
        jurors were writing down <span class="tei tei-q">“stupid
        things!”</span> on their slates, and she could even make out that one
        of them didn't know how to spell <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“stupid,”</span> and that he had to ask his neighbour to
        tell him. <span class="tei tei-q">“A nice muddle their slates'll be
        in before the trial's over!”</span> thought Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the jurors
        had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand,
        and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found
        an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor
        little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what
        had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged
        to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of
        very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Herald, read the accusation!”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this the White

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not yet, not yet!”</span> the Rabbit hastily
        interrupted. <span class="tei tei-q">“There's a great deal to come

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“First witness!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first witness
        was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of
        bread-and-butter in the other. <span class="tei tei-q">“I beg pardon,
        your Majesty,”</span> he began, <span class="tei tei-q">“for bringing
        these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent
        for.”</span></p><a name="fig61" id="fig61"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You ought to have finished,”</span> said the King.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“When did you begin?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hatter looked
        at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm
        with the Dormouse. <span class="tei tei-q">“Fourteenth of March, I
        think it was,”</span> he said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fifteenth,”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sixteenth,”</span> added the Dormouse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Write that down,”</span> the King said to the jury, and
        the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
        added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take off your hat,”</span> the King said to the
        Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It isn't mine,”</span> said the Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stolen!”</span> the King exclaimed, turning to the jury,
        who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I keep them to sell,”</span> the Hatter added as an
        explanation; <span class="tei tei-q">“I've none of my own. I'm a
        hatter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the Queen put
        on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale
        and fidgeted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give your evidence,”</span> said the King; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the
        spot.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This did not seem
        to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to
        the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit
        a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just at this
        moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good
        deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger
        again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court;
        but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as
        there was room for her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.”</span> said the
        Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. <span class="tei tei-q">“I can
        hardly breathe.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can't help it,”</span> said Alice very meekly:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm growing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You've no right to grow here,”</span> said the
        Dormouse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don't talk nonsense,”</span> said Alice more boldly:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you know you're growing too.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,”</span> said the
        Dormouse: <span class="tei tei-q">“not in that ridiculous
        fashion.”</span> And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
        other side of the court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this time the
        Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the
        Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the
        court, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bring me the list of the singers in
        the last concert!”</span> on which the wretched Hatter trembled so,
        that he shook both his shoes off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give your evidence,”</span> the King repeated angrily,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“or I'll have you executed, whether you're
        nervous or not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm a poor man, your Majesty,”</span> the Hatter began,
        in a trembling voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“— and I hadn't begun
        my tea&nbsp;— not above a week or so&nbsp;— and what with the
        bread-and-butter getting so thin&nbsp;— and the twinkling of the
        tea&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The twinkling of the what?”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It began with the tea,”</span> the Hatter replied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course twinkling begins with a <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">T</span></span>!”</span> said the King sharply.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you take me for a dunce? Go
        on!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm a poor man,”</span> the Hatter went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and most things twinkled after that&nbsp;— only the
        March Hare said&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I didn't!”</span> the March Hare interrupted in a great
        hurry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You did!”</span> said the Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I deny it!”</span> said the March Hare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He denies it,”</span> said the King: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“leave out that part.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said&nbsp;—”</span> the
        Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it
        too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After that,”</span> continued the Hatter, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cut some more bread-and-butter&nbsp;—”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But what did the Dormouse say?”</span> one of the jury
        asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That I can't remember,”</span> said the Hatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></em> remember,”</span> remarked the
        King, <span class="tei tei-q">“or I'll have you executed.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The miserable
        Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one
        knee. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm a poor man, your Majesty,”</span>
        he began.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You're a very poor speaker,”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here one of the
        guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers
        of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to
        you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at
        the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head
        first, and then sat upon it.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'm glad I've seen that done,”</span> thought Alice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I've so often read in the newspapers, at the
        end of trials, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There was some attempts at
        applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
        court,’</span> and I never understood what it meant till
        now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If that's all you know about it, you may stand
        down,”</span> continued the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can't go no lower,”</span> said the Hatter:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I'm on the floor, as it is.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you may <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        replied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the other
        guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!”</span> thought
        Alice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we shall get on
        better.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I'd rather finish my tea,”</span> said the Hatter, with
        an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of
        singers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You may go,”</span> said the King, and the Hatter
        hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes
        on.</p><a name="fig62" id="fig62"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“— and just take his head off outside,”</span> the Queen
        added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before
        the officer could get to the door.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Call the next witness!”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next witness
        was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and
        Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the
        way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give your evidence,”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shan't,”</span> said the cook.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King looked
        anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Your Majesty must cross-examine <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
        witness.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, if I must, I must,”</span> the King said, with a
        melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook
        till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What are tarts made of?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pepper, mostly,”</span> said the cook.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Treacle,”</span> said a sleepy voice behind her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Collar that Dormouse,”</span> the Queen shrieked out.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out
        of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some minutes
        the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out,
        and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
        disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Never mind!”</span> said the King, with an air of great
        relief. <span class="tei tei-q">“Call the next witness.”</span> And
        he added in an undertone to the Queen, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Really, my dear, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">you</span></em> must cross-examine the next
        witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice watched the
        White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see
        what the next witness would be like, <span class="tei tei-q">“— for
        they haven't got much evidence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yet,</span></em>”</span> she said to herself.
        Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of
        his shrill little voice, the name <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here!”</span> cried Alice, quite forgetting in the
        flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes,
        and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box
        with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
        of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her
        very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week
        before.</p><a name="fig65" id="fig65"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">beg</span></em> your pardon!”</span> she
        exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again
        as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept
        running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must
        be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would
        die.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The trial cannot proceed,”</span> said the King in a
        very grave voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“until all the jurymen are
        back in their proper places&nbsp;— <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all,</span></em>”</span> he repeated with great
        emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alice looked at
        the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in
        head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about
        in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out
        again, and put it right; <span class="tei tei-q">“not that it
        signifies much,”</span> she said to herself; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I should think it would be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite</span></em> as
        much use in the trial one way up as the other.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
        jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their
        slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set
        to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all
        except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but
        sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you know about this business?”</span> the King
        said to Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nothing,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nothing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">whatever</span></em>?”</span> persisted the
        King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nothing whatever,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That's very important,”</span> the King said, turning to
        the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their
        slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">un</span></em>important, your Majesty means, of
        course,”</span> he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
        making faces at him as he spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Un</span></em>important, of course, I
        meant,”</span> the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an
        undertone, <span class="tei tei-q">“important&nbsp;—
        unimportant&nbsp;— unimportant&nbsp;— important&nbsp;—”</span> as if
        he were trying which word sounded best.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the jury
        wrote it down <span class="tei tei-q">“important,”</span> and some
        <span class="tei tei-q">“unimportant.”</span> Alice could see this,
        as she was near enough to look over their slates; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but it doesn't matter a bit,”</span> she thought to
        herself.</p><a name="fig66" id="fig66"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment the
        King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book,
        cackled out <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence!”</span> and read out
        from his book, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rule Forty-two. <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everybody looked

        Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are,”</span> said the King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nearly two miles high,”</span> added the Queen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, I shan't go, at any rate,”</span> said Alice:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“besides, that's not a regular rule: you
        invented it just now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's the oldest rule in the book,”</span> said the
        King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then it ought to be Number One,”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King turned
        pale, and shut his note-book hastily. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Consider your verdict,”</span> he said to the jury, in a
        low, trembling voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There's more evidence to come yet, please your
        Majesty,”</span> said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this paper has just been picked
        up.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What's in it?”</span> said the Queen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I haven't opened it yet,”</span> said the White Rabbit,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but it seems to be a letter, written by the
        prisoner to&nbsp;— to somebody.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It must have been that,”</span> said the King,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“unless it was written to nobody, which isn't
        usual, you know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who is it directed to?”</span> said one of the
        jurymen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It isn't directed at all,”</span> said the White Rabbit;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in fact, there's nothing written on the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">outside.</span></em>”</span> He unfolded the
        paper as he spoke, and added <span class="tei tei-q">“It isn't a
        letter, after all: it's a set of verses.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?”</span> asked
        another of the jurymen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, they're not,”</span> said the White Rabbit,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and that's the queerest thing about
        it.”</span> (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He must have imitated somebody else's hand,”</span> said
        the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Please your Majesty,”</span> said the Knave,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't write it, and they can't prove I
        did: there's no name signed at the end.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If you didn't sign it,”</span> said the King,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that only makes the matter worse. You
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></em> have meant some mischief, or
        else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
        general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever
        thing the King had said that day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, you don't even know what they're
        about!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The White Rabbit
        put on his spectacles. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where shall I begin,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“that saves a world of trouble, you know, as
        we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,”</span> he went on,
        spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one
        eye; <span class="tei tei-q">“I seem to see some meaning in them,

        added, turning to the Knave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Knave shook
        his head sadly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do I look like it?”</span>
        he said. (Which he certainly did <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had
        left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
        mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
        trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        There was a dead silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It's a pun!”</span> the King added in an offended tone,
        and everybody laughed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the jury consider
        their verdict,”</span> the King said, for about the twentieth time
        that day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, no!”</span> said the Queen. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stuff and nonsense!”</span> said Alice loudly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The idea of having the sentence
        first!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hold your tongue!”</span> said the Queen, turning
        purple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I won't!”</span> said Alice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Off with her head!”</span> the Queen shouted at the top
        of her voice. Nobody moved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who cares for you?”</span> said Alice, (she had grown to
        her full size by this time.) <span class="tei tei-q">“You're nothing
        but a pack of cards!”</span></p><a name="fig68" id="fig68"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/alice42.png" alt=
        "Alice saying: “You're nothing but a pack of cards!”" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this the whole
        pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a
        little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat
        them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the
        lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that
        had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wake up, Alice dear!”</span> said her sister;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, what a long sleep you've
        had!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, I've had such a curious dream!”</span> said Alice,
        and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all
        these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading
        about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></em> a curious dream, dear,
        certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.”</span> So
        Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
        what a wonderful dream it had been.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But her sister sat
        still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching
        the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful
        Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was
        her dream:&nbsp;—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, she dreamed
        of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped
        upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into
        hers&nbsp;— she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
        queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">would</span></em> always get into her
        eyes&nbsp;— and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole
        place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
        sister's dream.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The long grass
        rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by&nbsp;— the
        frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring
        pool&nbsp;— she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March
        Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill
        voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to
        execution&nbsp;— once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's
        knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it&nbsp;— once more the
        shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil,
        and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed
        up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So she sat on,
        with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she
        knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull
        reality&nbsp;— the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the
        pool rippling to the waving of the reeds&nbsp;— the rattling teacups
        would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to
        the voice of the shepherd boy&nbsp;— and the sneeze of the baby, the
        shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
        (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard&nbsp;— while
        the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the
        Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, she
        pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the
        after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through
        all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood:
        and how she would gather about her other little children, and make
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">their</span></em> eyes bright and eager with
        many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of
        long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and
        find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own
        child-life, and the happy summer days.</p>

              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
