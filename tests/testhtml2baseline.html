<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>


<p>Within recent years fairly exhaustive studies have been made on
many aspects of American science and technology. For example,
there have been numerous works relating to clocks and clockmakers,
so that the collector and horological student have a number of
useful sources on which to rely. More recently there has been a
series of publications on the development of American tools and
their makers. Until now, however, no systematic study has been
attempted of the scientific instruments used in the United States
from its colonial beginnings. While several useful regional lists
of instrument makers in early America have been compiled from
advertisements in contemporary newspapers and published as
short articles, these, however, are fragmentary, and are inadequate
to the need for documentation in this field.</p>

<p>With the rapidly growing interest in the history of science, it
becomes necessary to have a more complete background for the
student and the historian alike. It is desirable to have a more
comprehensive picture of the work of the scientific practitioners of
the earlier periods of American scientific development, and of their
tools. At the same time it is essential to have a history of the
development and distribution and use of scientific instruments by
others than the practitioners and teachers. The role of the instrument
maker in the American Colonies was an important one&mdash;as
it was in each epoch of the history of science in Europe&mdash;and it
deserves to be reported.</p>

<p>To make a comprehensive study of American scientific instruments
and instrument makers in the American Colonies is no
simple matter, partly because of an indifference to the subject in
the past, and partly because of the great volume of sources that
must be sifted to accomplish it. Such a project would require
an organized search of all published reference works relating to the
field and associated topics, of all contemporary newspapers for
advertisements and notices, of civil records filed in state and community
archives, of business account-books and records that have
been preserved, and of business directories of the period under
consideration. In addition, such a study would require the compilation
of an inventory of all surviving instruments in private and
public collections, and a correlation of all the data that could be
assembled from these sources.</p>

<p>The present study attempts only in part to accomplish this aim,
being no more than a preliminary compilation of the scientific
instruments known to have been used during the first two centuries
of American colonial existence. It merely attempts to assemble
all the data that is presently available in scattered sources, and
to organize it in a usable form for the student and historian of
American science. A supplement relating to 19th-century instruments
and instrument makers is in progress.</p>

<p>The most that is hoped for the present work is that it will be
of temporary assistance, serving to bring forth additional information
on the subject from sources not previously available or known.</p>

SCIENTIFIC
INSTRUMENTS</p>

<p class="center"><i>and Their Makers</i>
</p>



<p><i>The Tools of Science</i></p>


<p>Philosophical and Practical Instruments</p>

<p>Development of the sciences in the American Colonies was
critically dependent upon the available tools&mdash;scientific instruments&mdash;and
the men who made and used them. These tools may
be separated into two groups. The first group consists of philosophical
instruments and scientific teaching apparatus produced
and employed for experimentation and teaching in educational
institutions. The second includes the so-called "mathematical
instruments" of practical use, which were employed by mathematical
practitioners and laymen alike for the mensural and nautical
needs of the Colonies. It is particularly with this second
group that the present study is concerned.</p>

<p>It has been generally assumed that scientific instruments, as well
as the instrument makers, of the first two centuries of American
colonization were imported from England, and that the movement
declined by the beginning of the 19th century with the development
of skilled native craftsmen.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This assumption is basically true for
those instruments grouped under philosophical and scientific apparatus
for experimentation and teaching. Almost all of these items
were in fact imported from England and France until well into the
19th century.</p>

<p>Likewise, the very earliest examples of mathematical instruments
for surveying and navigation in the Colonies were imported with
the settlers from England. It was not long after the establishment
of the first settlements, however, that the settlers, and later the
first generation of native Americans, began to produce their own
instruments. Records derived from historical archives and from
the instruments themselves reveal that a considerable number of
the instruments available and used in the Colonies before 1800
were of native production. Apparently, relatively few instrument
makers immigrated to the American continent before the end of the
Revolutionary War. Later, with the beginning of the 19th century,
makers of and dealers in instruments in England and France
became aware of the growing new market, and emigrated in numbers
to establish shops in the major cities of commerce in the
United States.</p>

<p>Quite possibly the few instrument makers trained in England
who immigrated to the Colonies in the early epoch of Colonial
development may have in turn trained others in their communities,
although no evidence has yet been found. Perhaps more data on
this aspect of the subject will eventually come to light.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that a few mathematical practitioners
and instrument makers lived and worked in the New England
colonies as early as the first century of colonization.</p>

<p>The evidence, frankly meager, consists of two items. The first
is a reference relating to James Halsie of Boston. In a land deed
made out to him in 1674 he was referred to as a "Mathematician."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Halsie was listed as a freeman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
in 1690. He apparently was the forbear of the several members of
the Halsy family of instrument makers of Boston of the 18th
century, mentioned later in this study. It is uncertain whether the
use of the term "mathematician" in this connection meant an
artisan, but if not it may be inferred that Halsie was a practitioner.</p>

<p>The second piece of evidence is even more slender; it consists of
an inscription upon a dialing rule (fig. 1) for making sundials and
charts. The instrument is of cast brass, 20-7/16 inches long and
1-11/16 inches wide. The date "1674" is inscribed on the rule together
with the name of its original owner, "Arthur Willis." The instrument
almost certainly was produced by the school of Henry
Sutton, the notable English instrument maker who worked in
Threadneedle Street in London from about 1637 through 1665.
The name and date inscriptions are consistent and contemporary
with the workmanship of the rule, and were probably inscribed by
the maker for the original owner. It is conceivable that Arthur
Willis was an Englishman and that the rule was brought into this
country even in relatively recent times. However, it is claimed
that the rule was owned and used by Nathaniel Footes, surveyor
of Springfield, Massachusetts. Nathaniel Footes, believed to have
been originally from Salem, subsequently moved from Springfield
to Wethersfield, Conn. The instrument was later owned and used
in Connecticut not later than the early 19th century<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the forbears
of Mr. Newton C. Brainard of Hartford, Connecticut. If
records relating to Willis as a resident of the New England colonies
can be recovered, it may then be possible to establish whether he
worked in the Colonies as a mathematical practitioner in the 17th
century. His name is included on a tentative basis.</p>

<p>The Need for Instruments</p>

<p>The production and use of scientific instruments in the American
Colonies reflected colonial development in education and in territorial
and economic expansion, and closely paralleled the same
development in England, where the first mathematical practitioners
were the teachers of navigational and commercial arithmetic
and the surveyors employed in the redistribution of land
following the dissolution of the monasteries. As the communities
became established and the settlers gained a foothold on the soil,
their attention naturally turned to improving their lot by expanding
the land under cultivation and by trading their products for other
needs. The growth of the communities became increasingly rapid
from the end of the 17th century, and the land expansion closely
paralleled the development of trade. The educational institutions
placed greater emphasis on the sciences as their curriculums
developed. Particularly there was a greater preoccupation with
the sciences on the part of the layman because of the need for
knowledge of surveying and navigation.</p>

<p>The colonial school curriculum was accordingly designed from
the practical point of view to emphasize practical mathematics, and
there was an increasing demand for instruction in all aspects of the
subject. One of the earliest advertisements of this nature appeared
in <i>The Boston Gazette</i> in March 1719. In the issue of February 19
to March 7 the advertisement stated that:</p>

<blockquote><p>This day Mr. Samuel Grainger opens his school at the House formerly
Sir Charles Hobby's, where will be taught Grammar Writing after a free and
easy manner in all the usual Hands, Arithmetick in a concise and Practical
Method, Merchants Accompts, and the Mathematicks.</p>

<p>He hopes that more thinking People will in no wise be discouraged from
sending their children thither, on the account of the reports newly reviv'd,
because these dancing Phaenomena's were never seen nor heard of in School
Hours.</p></blockquote>
The advertisement was further amplified in its second appearance,
in the issue of March 21-22, 1719:</p>

<blockquote><p>At the house formerly Sir Charles Hobby's are taught grammar, writing,
after a free &amp; easy manner in all hands usually practiced, Arithmetick Vulgar
and Decimal in a concise and Practical Method, Merchants Accompts,
Geometry, Algebra, Mensuration, Geography, Trigonometry, Astronomy,
Navigation and other parts of the Mathematicks, with the use of the Globes
and other Mathematical Instruments, by Samuel Grainger.</p>

<p>They whose business won't permit 'em to attend the usual School Hours,
shall be carefully attended and Instructed in the Evenings.</p></blockquote>

<p>R. F. Seybold<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has noted that: "In advertisements of 1753
and 1754, John Lewis, of New York City, announced 'What is
called a New Method of Navigation, is an excellent Method of
Trigonometry here particularly applied to Navigation; But it is
of great use in all kinds of measuring and in solving many Arithmetical
Questions.' James Cosgrove, of Philadelphia, in 1755,
taught 'geometry, trigonometry, and their application in surveying,
navigation, etc.,' and Alexander Power, in 1766, 'With
their Application to Surveying, Navigation, Geography, and
Astronomy'." These subjects were featured also in the evening
schools of the colonial period, maintained by private schoolmasters
in some of the larger communities for the education of those who
could not attend school in the daytime.</p>

<p>According to Seybold, surveying and navigation were the most
popular mathematical subjects taught. Some explanation is to be
derived from the statement by Schoen<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that: "In the days when
the 'bounds' of great wilderness tracts were being marked off by
deep-cut blazes in the trees along a line, a knowledge of land surveying
was a useful skill, and many a boy learned its elements by
following the 'boundsgoer' in his work of 'running the line.' And
those who did not actually take part in running the line must have
attended many a gay springtime 'processioning' when neighbors
made a festive occasion out of 'perambulating the bounds'." "Vague
land grants and inaccurate surveys," he adds, "made the subject
of boundary lines a prime issue in the everyday life of colonial
homes."</p>

<p>At the same time there was interest in the other aspects of the
mathematical sciences. As early as 1743, for instance, a Harvard
mathematician named Nathan Prince advertised in Boston that
if he were given "suitable Encouragement" he would establish a
school to teach "Geography and Astronomy, With the Use of the
Globes, and the several kinds of Projecting the Sphere" among
other things.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A decade later, Theophilus Grew, professor in the
academy at Philadelphia which has become the University of Pennsylvania,
published a treatise on globes, with the title:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Description</i> and <i>Use</i> of the <i>Globes</i>, Celestial and Terrestrial; With
Variety for <i>Examples</i> for the Learner's <i>Exercises</i>: Intended for the Use of
Such Persons as would attain to the Knowledge of those <i>Instruments</i>; But
Chiefly designed for the <i>Instruction</i> of the young <i>Gentlemen</i> at the <i>Academy</i> in
Philadelphia. To which is added Rules for working all the Cases in Plain
and Spherical Triangles without a Scheme. By <i>Theophilus Grew</i>, Mathematical
Professor. Germantown, Printed by Christopher Sower, 1753.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, the need for practical mathematical instruments for the
surveyor and navigator became critical in proportion to the need
for men to make and use them, and it is not surprising to discover
that the majority of the instruments produced and advertised by
early American makers were for surveying, with nautical instruments
in second place. Generally, the surveyors were not professionals;
they were farmers, tradesmen, or craftsmen with a sound
knowledge of basic arithmetic and occasionally with some advanced
study of the subject as taught in the evening schools. The surveying
of provincial and intercolonial boundaries required greater
skill, however, as well as a knowledge of astronomy, and this work
was relegated to the scientific men of the period.</p>

<p>As the increasing preoccupation with subdivision of land and with
surveying led to a greater demand for suitable instruments, it was
the skilled craftsmen of the community, such as the clockmaker
and the silversmith, that were called upon to produce them.
Superb examples also were produced by the advanced scientific
men, or "mathematical practitioners," of the period.</p>


<p>Colonial Training in Instrument Making</p>

<p>One may well ask, where did these native craftsmen acquire the
knowledge that enabled them to produce so skillfully the accurate
and often delicate mathematical instruments? There were a
number of possible sources for this knowledge. The first source
lies in England, where some of these craftsmen could have studied
or served apprenticeships. After completing their apprenticeship
with English mathematical practitioners, they may have immigrated
to the Colonies and taught the craft to others. This seems
to be entirely plausible, and was probably true, for example, of
Thomas Harland the clockmaker, Anthony Lamb, and perhaps
several others. However, these were the exceptions instead of the
rule, since a biographical study of the instrument makers in general
reveals that they were for the most part native to America. It is
not likely that the one or two isolated practitioners that had been
trained in England could have taught so many others who worked
in the same epoch.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 2.&mdash;Title page of <i>The Surveyor</i> by Aaron Rathborne, published in London
in 1616. The book was one of the sources of information for American makers
of mathematical instruments.]</p>

<p>Another source for this knowledge of instrument making was
probably the reference works on the subject that had been published
in England and in France. As an example, Nicolas Bion's
<i>Traitè de la Construction et des Principaux Usages des Instruments
de Mathematique</i>, which had been first published in 1686, was
translated into English by Edmund Stone in 1723, and went into
several English editions. Copies of this work in English undoubtedly
found their way to America soon after publication. Other
popular works were Aaron Rathbone's <i>The Surveyor</i>, which
appeared in London in 1616 (see fig. 2); William Leybourn's <i>The
Compleat Surveyor</i>, in 1653; and George Atwell's <i>Faithfull Surveyour</i>,
in 1662. Other works popular in the Colonies were R. Norwood's
<i>Epitome, or The Doctrine of Triangles</i> (London, 1659) and J. Love's
<i>Geodasia, or the Art of Surveying</i> (London, 1688).</p>

<p>These works undoubtedly inspired similar publications in America,
for many books on surveying and navigation appeared there
before the beginning of the 19th century. Chief among them
were S. Moore's <i>An Accurate System of Surveying</i> (Litchfield, Conn.,
1796), Z. Jess's <i>A Compendious System of Practical Surveying</i>
(Wilmington, 1799), Abel Flint's <i>Surveying</i> (Hartford, 1804), and
J. Day's <i>Principles of Navigation and Surveying</i> (New Haven, 1817).</p>

<p>The published works were unquestionably responsible for much
of the training in the making of mathematical instruments in
America, although no documentary evidence has yet been recovered
to prove it.</p>

<p>Another important influence on early American instrument-making
which must be noted was that of the clockmaker as an
artisan. A comprehensive study of surviving instruments and
related records has revealed that only a few of the many clockmakers
working in the American Colonies in the 18th century made
mathematical instruments. Yet, a large proportion of the surviving
surveying and nautical instruments produced before 1800 were
the work of clockmakers. Classic among these must be noted the
instruments produced by the brothers David and Benjamin Rittenhouse
(see p. 15 and figs. 3 and 4), as well as the fine surveying
instruments made by four separate members of the Chandlee
family, whose clockmaking traditions began early in the 17th century
(see p. 54).</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 4.&mdash;Surveying compass marked "Potts and Rittenhouse." Believed to be

<p>Finally, one must not overlook the fact that examples of English
and other European instruments were available in the Colonies,
and that at least some of the early colonial makers undoubtedly
copied them. It is apparent from some surviving early American
instruments that the materials, designs, dimensions, and details of
European prototypes had been deliberately copied. It is possible
to see in public collections, for instance, a Davis quadrant of English
manufacture exhibited beside a later example, signed by a New
England maker, which comes extraordinarily close to duplicating
it in every feature.</p>

<p>As with the presumed influence of published works, the practice
of copying imported instruments cannot be documented, but it
must have been engaged in by many of the unschooled New England
instrument makers. By this means some may even have
profited to the degree that they became professional craftsmen
without benefit of formal apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Yet it is remarkable that although numerous instruments were
produced by native artisans, in addition to the substantial number
which were imported before the end of the 18th century, relatively
few specimens have survived in public collections as well as in
private hands. Despite the exhaustive combing of attics and barns
throughout the country by dealers in antiques and by avid collectors
during the past several decades, the number of surviving
instruments now known is incredibly small in comparison with the
numbers known to have been made locally or imported before the
beginning of the 19th century. Since instruments are not items
which would ordinarily be deliberately discarded or destroyed, or
melted down for the recovery of the metal, this small percentage
of survival presents a puzzle which has not been resolved.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mathematical_Practitioners" id="The_Mathematical_Practitioners"></a><i>The Mathematical Practitioners</i></h2>


<p>The Rittenhouse Brothers</p>

<p>Notable among the American practitioners was David Rittenhouse
(1732-1796) of Norristown and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
who was established as a clockmaker and surveyor in Philadelphia
by 1749. He surveyed the boundary between Pennsylvania and
Delaware in 1763 with instruments of his own design and construction.
Six years later, in 1769, he successfully calculated the
transit of Venus and later observed that planet with astronomical
instruments he had constructed himself. In the following year,
1770, he built the first American astronomical observatory, in
Philadelphia. Two orreries that he designed and built&mdash;at the
University of Pennsylvania and at Princeton University&mdash;survive
as outstanding examples of American craftsmanship.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Several of
his surveying and astronomical instruments are exhibited in the
collections of the U.S. National Museum. David Rittenhouse
is credited with being the originator of a declination arc on the
surveying compass, a feature to be copied by a number of later
instrument makers.</p>

<p>David's brother, Benjamin Rittenhouse (1740-c.1820), served
in the Revolution and was wounded at Brandywine. He superintended
the Government's gunlock factory at Philadelphia in
1778 and achieved recognition as a maker of clocks and surveying
instruments (see fig. 8).<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> During one period of his career he worked
in partnership with his brother David. An interesting advertisement
appeared in the May 14, 1785, issue of <i>The Pennsylvania
Packet</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>WANTED, An ingenious Lad not exceeding 14 years of age, of a reputable
family, as an Apprentice to learn the Art and Mistery of making Clocks and
Surveying Instruments. Any lad inclining to go an apprentice to the above
Trade, the terms on which he will be taken may [be] known by enquiring of
Mr. David Rittenhouse, in Philadelphia, or at the subscriber's house in
Worcester township, Montgomery county. Benjamin Rittenhouse.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 9.&mdash;Portrait of Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820) by unknown artist.]</p>


<p>Andrew Ellicott</p>

<p>A name closely associated with that of the Rittenhouse brothers
was that of Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820) of Solebury, Pennsylvania,
and Ellicotts Mills, Maryland. Andrew was the son of Joseph
Ellicott, the clockmaker and pioneer industrialist who founded
Ellicotts Mills. Although a Quaker, Andrew (fig. 9) served in
the Revolution, and he became one of the most distinguished
engineers of the new republic. He worked as a clockmaker and
instrument maker from 1774 to 1780. In 1784 he ran the boundary
between Virginia and Pennsylvania and in the following year he
was a member of the survey that continued Mason and Dixon's
line. In 1785 and 1786 he served on the Pennsylvania commissions
that surveyed the western and northern boundaries of the state,
and in 1789 he served on the commission that fixed the boundary
between New York and Pennsylvania. Between 1791 and 1793 he
surveyed the site of the city of Washington, D.C., and redrew
L'Enfant's plan for the city.</p>

<p>In early 1793 Ellicott was appointed commissioner by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the project of viewing and
locating a road from Reading to Presque Isle, now Erie. It was
an extremely difficult undertaking, but Ellicott completed the
work by the autumn of 1796, including laying out the towns of
Erie, Warren, and Franklin.</p>

<p>In May 1796 Ellicott was commissioned by President Washington
to survey and mark the boundary line between the United States
and the Spanish Province of Florida in accordance with the
provisions of the Pinkney-Godoy Treaty of October 27, 1795.
This line was to begin at the point where the 31st parallel of north
latitude intersected the Mississippi River, and to proceed thence
along that parallel eastward to the Appalachicola River for about
400 miles.</p>

<p>In 1801 Ellicott was offered the position of surveyor general of
the United States by President Jefferson. Ellicott declined, but
subsequently accepted the secretaryship of the land office of
Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1808.</p>

<p>In 1811 Ellicott became commissioner to represent Georgia in
locating the Georgia-North Carolina boundary, a project on which
he was engaged for the major part of the following year.</p>

<p>In 1815 President Madison appointed Ellicott professor of
mathematics at West Point, with the rank of major. This is an
appointment he kept until his death in 1820. It was interrupted
in 1817 when the Government required his services as astronomer
to locate a portion of the United States-Canadian boundary in
accordance with the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 10.&mdash;Transit and equal-altitude instrument (left) made by Ellicott in 1789

Florida and in other surveys. USNM 152080.]</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 11.&mdash;Zenith sector with focal length of 6 ft., made by David Rittenhouse
and revised by Andrew Ellicott. Described in <i>Journal of Andrew Ellicott</i>

<p>Ellicott was a member of a number of learned societies, including
the American Philosophical Society, the Society for the Promotion
of Useful Arts of Albany, and of the National Institute of France.</p>

<p>Ellicott constructed a number of instruments for surveying and
astronomical observation, and he designed and used others that
were produced by his friend David Rittenhouse<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (see figs. 10, 11).
Of particular interest in connection with Ellicott's career as a
clockmaker and instrument maker are two advertisements that
appeared in the Baltimore newspapers. The first one was in the
<i>Maryland Journal and Baltimore Daily Advertiser on April 7, 1778</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ellicott's Upper Mills, April 4, 1778. Wanted, a person acquainted with the
Clock-Making business, and able to work by directions. Such a person will
meet with good encouragement by applying to Andrew Ellicott, sen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second advertisement, in the same vein, appeared in the May
16, 1780, issue of the <i>Maryland Journal</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Good Encouragement will be given to either Clock or Mathematical instrument
makers, by the subscriber, living in Baltimore-Town. Andrew Ellicott.</p></blockquote>


<p>Owen Biddle</p>

<p>Another mathematical practitioner associated with David Rittenhouse
in his observations of the transit of Venus was Owen
Biddle (1737-1799) of the North Ward, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In early life Biddle was an apothecary and a clock- and watch-maker.
In his shop "next door to Roberts warehouse" he sold
clock and watch parts and tools. From 1764 to 1770 he advertised
himself as "Clockmaker, and scientist, statesman and patriot."
As a Quaker, he participated actively in civic and patriotic affairs
of Philadelphia. During the American Revolution, in spite of his
religious affiliation, he fought for the defense of the Colonies and
was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Forage. Evidencing sincere
repentance, he was permitted to rejoin the Society of Friends.</p>

<p>In 1769 Biddle took an active part in the preparations made by
the American Philosophical Society for the observation of the
transit of Venus. With Joel Baily he was sent to Cape Henlopen,
Delaware, with a large reflecting telescope borrowed from the
Library Company. The expedition was described in the <i>Transactions
of the American Philosophical Society</i> in 1771 in an article entitled
"An Account of the Transit of Venus, over the Sun's Disk, as
observed near Cape Henlopen, on Delaware Bay, June 3rd, 1769
by Owen Biddle, Joel Baily and (Richard Thomas) Drawn by
Owen Biddle." In addition to his trade in clocks and watches,
Biddle also made mathematical instruments and was well known
in his native city as a merchant, inventor, and ironmaster.</p>


<p>Benjamin Banneker</p>

<p>A name that is too often ignored in the history of science in colonial
America is that of a free Negro, Benjamin Banneker (c. 1734-1806)
of Baltimore. A farmer by occupation, Banneker was the
son of a native African slave and a free mulatto woman. In his
spare time he attended the school of a Quaker farmer; the only
book he owned was the Bible. When he was a young man he acquired
a watch from a trader, and from it he developed his love of
science and instruments. Although he had never seen a clock, he
constructed one based on drawings he made from the watch.
Banneker was called upon to assist in the construction of the mills
for the Ellicotts, and it was natural that his clock, which was the
marvel of the Negro settlement, should come to the attention of
Joseph Ellicott. Ellicott became interested in Banneker's thirst
for knowledge and allowed him the use of his tools, scientific instruments,
and technical books. Among the books were Mayer's
<i>Tables</i>, James Ferguson's <i>Astronomy</i>, and Leadbeater's <i>Lunar
Tables</i>. Banneker absorbed these and other works that he borrowed
and went on to explore the wonderful new world they opened
up for him. He pursued astronomical studies, and within three
years he began to make calculations (fig. 12) for an almanac. After
completing the calculations for the year 1791, he went on to produce
a set of calculations for 1792. During this period he mastered
the use of surveying instruments and made a firsthand study of
tides in the region. His great opportunity came when Andrew
Ellicott was chosen to make a survey for the city of Washington
and hired Banneker as an assistant. While thus employed, Banneker
completed his almanac and gave it to George Ellicott,
Andrew's cousin, as a subject of possible interest. Apparently
George Ellicott turned it over to the Honorable James McHenry
of Baltimore, who in turned submitted it to the Philadelphia firm
of Goddard &amp; Angell, who published it (fig. 13). Banneker mailed
a copy of his <i>Benjamin Banneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia
And Maryland Almanac and Ephemeris For the Year of Our
Lord, 1792</i> to Thomas Jefferson, who was so impressed with it
that he forwarded it to the Marquis de Condorcet, secretary of the
French Academy of Sciences. After his work with Ellicott had
been completed, Banneker retired to his farm to produce almanacs
annually until 1802. When he died in 1806 he was eulogized before
the French Academy by the Marquis de Condorcet, and William
Pitt placed his name in the records of the English Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 12.&mdash;Letter from Benjamin Banneker to George Ellicott dated October
13, 1789, regarding astronomical data for the compilation of Banneker's
almanac. Photo courtesy Maryland Historical Society.]</p>


<p>Joel Baily</p>

<p>Still another 18th-century practitioner was Joel Baily (1732-1797),
a Quaker of West Bradford, Pennsylvania. In addition to
his trade as a clockmaker and gunsmith, Baily achieved local
eminence as an astronomer, mathematician, and surveyor.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1764, at the time that Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon
established their headquarters near his farm, Baily was the local
surveyor. Obtaining employment with the expedition, he worked
with Mason and Dixon until the completion of their survey in 1768.
Baily was subsequently employed by Mason and Dixon to build
pine frames for carrying the 20-foot rods to be used in the second
measurement of courses from the Stargazers' Stone southward.</p>

<p>In 1769 Baily was appointed by the American Philosophical
Society to work with Owen Biddle in setting up the station at Cape
Henlopen for observation of the transit of Venus. In 1770 he
again worked with Biddle in taking the courses and distances from
the New Castle Court House to the State House Observatory in
Philadelphia for determining the latitude and longitude of each.
In the same year Baily was elected a member of the American
Philosophical Society.</p>


<p>Reverend John Prince</p>

<p>Another noteworthy mathematical practitioner of the period was
the Reverend John Prince (1751-1836) of Salem, Massachusetts.
The son of a hatter and mechanic, Prince studied natural philosophy
under John Winthrop at Harvard and received his B.A.
degree in 1776. He was a student of divinity under Samuel
Williams and was ordained in 1779 at the First Church in Salem.
Although an amateur of the sciences, Prince became a skilled
maker of scientific instruments. He made, sold, and repaired
instruments for the use of numerous colleges, schools, and academies,
including Brown, Dartmouth, Rutgers, Harvard, Union,
Amherst, and Williams. Among other accomplishments, he
effected "improvements" on the lucernal microscope and the air
pump.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 13.&mdash;Title page of one of Banneker's almanacs. The portrait of Banneker
was made by Timothy Woods in 1793 for the publisher and reproduced by
woodcut. Banneker's first almanac was published in Philadelphia in 1792.]</p>


<p>Amasa Holcomb</p>

<p>Although he was born in the 18th century, Amasa Holcomb
(1787-1875) properly belongs to a later period. An astronomer
and telescope maker of Southwick, Massachusetts, Holcomb
became a surveyor in 1808. An autobiographical sketch noted
that "he manufactured about this time a good many sets of surveyors
instruments&mdash;compasses, chains, scales, protractors and dividers,
some for his pupils and some for others."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>




<h2><a name="Instruments_of_Metal" id="Instruments_of_Metal"></a>Instruments of Metal</h2>


<p>Pre-Revolutionary Immigrant Makers</p>

<p>According to present evidence, only a few makers of metal
instruments emigrated from England to the Colonies before the
beginning of the Revolutionary War. A slightly larger number
emigrated after the war had ended. In almost every instance, the
immigrant instrument makers settled in the major cities, which
were the shipping centers of the new country. The reason is
obvious: in these cities there was the greatest demand for nautical
and other instruments.</p>

<p>One of the earliest immigrant instrument makers arrived in
Boston in 1739. According to an advertisement that appeared in
<i>The Boston Gazette</i> in the issue of July 16-23, 1739, there had</p>

<blockquote><p>Arriv'd here by Capt. <i>Gerry</i> from <i>London</i> John Dabney, junr. who serv'd his
time to Mr. Jonathan Sisson, Mathematical Instrument Maker to his Royal
Highness, the Prince of Wales. Makes and sells all sorts of Mathematical
Instruments, in Silver, Brass, or Ivory, at Reasonable Rates, at Mr. Rowland
Houghton's Shop the north side of the Town Huse in Boston.</p>

<p>N.B. Said Dabney, sets Loadstones to a greater Perfection than any
heretofore.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dabney's master, Jonathan Sisson (1694-1749) originally of
Lincolnshire, with a shop in the Strand, London, was a well-known
maker of optical and mathematical instruments in the early decades
of the 18th century. He was particularly noted for the exact
division of scales, and examples of his work are to be found in the
major collections.</p>

<p>Dabney's name appeared again several years later, in the Supplement
to the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> for December 12, 1743, and
again in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> for December 19 of the same year,
with the following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote><p>To be shown by John Dabney, Mathematical Instrument maker, in Milk
Street, Boston, on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday Evenings, from five to
eight o'clock, for the Entertainment of the Curious, the Magic Lanthorn
an Optick Machine, which exhibits a great Number of wonderful and surprising
Figures, prodigious large, and vivid, at Half a Crown each, Old Tenor.</p></blockquote>

<p>In New York City, one of the earliest immigrant instrument
makers was Charles Walpole, who established a shop at a corner in
Wall Street, according to a notice in the May 26, 1746, issue of the
<i>New York Evening Post</i>. The announcement stated that Walpole
was a "citizen of London" and that at his shop "all sorts of Mathematical
Instruments, whether in silver or brass, are made and
mended...."</p>

<p>In the May 21, 1753, issue of <i>The New York Gazette or The
Weekly Post Boy</i> there was an announcement by the widow of
Balthaser Sommer who lived on Pot-Baker's Hill in Smith Street
in New York City and who advertised herself as a "grinder of
all sorts of optic glasses, spying glasses, of all lengths, spectacles,
reading glasses for near-sighted people or others; also spying glasses
of 3 feet long which are to set on a common Walking-Cane and
yet be carried as a Pocket-Book."</p>

<p>John Benson emigrated from Birmingham, England, and established
a lapidary and optical store in May 1793 at 12 Princess
Street in New York, where he produced miniatures, lockets,
rings, glasses, "as well as Spectacles, single reading and burning
glasses, and where he also polished scratch'd glasses." In July 1797
he moved to 106 Pearl Street where he sold green goggles, thermometers,
and opera and spy glasses, in addition to an assortment of
jewelry. In September 1798 he was established at a new location,
147 Pearl Street, "At the sign of The Green Spectacles" where he
specialized in optical goods. He featured for rent or sale a "Portable
Camera Obscura" for the use of artists in drawing landscapes.
His advertisements chronicled each change in location in the issues
of <i>The New York Daily Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>A craftsman whose name is well known in scientific circles was
Anthony Lamb, who advertised in 1753 as a mathematical instrument
maker living on Hunter's Key, New York. He claimed that
he could furnish</p>

<blockquote><p>Godfrey's newly invented quadrant, for taking the latitude or other altitudes
at sea; hydrometers for trying the exact strength of spirits, large surveying
instruments in a more curious manner than usual; which may be used in any
weather without exception, small ditto which may be fixed on the end of a
walking stick, and lengthened to a commodious height, gauging instruments
as now in use, according to an act of assembly with all other mathematical
instruments for sea or land, by wholesale or retail at reasonable rates.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lamb had served an apprenticeship with Henry Carter, a
mathematical  instrument maker in  London. In July 1724 he
became an accomplice of Jack Sheppard, a notorious burglar, and
was arrested and sentenced to the gallows in 1724. As he was
awaiting execution on the gallows at Tyburn, his sentence was
commuted to transportation to Virginia for a period of seven
years, inasmuch as this was his first offence. After he had completed
his term of seven years in Virginia he moved to Philadelphia,
where he opened a shop as an instrument maker and a private
school for teaching technical subjects. The curriculum included
surveying, navigation, and mathematics. Although his enterprises
prospered, he moved to New York. There he married a
Miss Ham and established himself in a respectable position.
Lamb's first advertisement in New York appeared on January 23,
1749. He died on December 11, 1784, at the age of 81, and two
days later he was eulogized in <i>The New York Packet</i> where he was
mentioned as "a steady friend to the liberties of America."</p>

<p>John Lamb (1735-1800), Anthony's son, learned and practiced
his father's craft for a time and worked as a partner in the firm of
A. Lamb &amp; Son. He subsequently became a wine and sugar
merchant, achieved considerable wealth, married well, and was
accepted by the gentry of the city. He was a firm patriot and from
1765 he was active as the leader of the Sons of Liberty. He
served in several major engagements in the American Revolution
and in 1783 was brevetted a brigadier-general.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The immigrant instrument makers were not confined to those
working in glass, however. One of the earlier immigrant craftsmen
was Charles Blundy, a London watchmaker who established
himself on Church Street in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1753.
He notified the public that in addition to watches he sold thermometers
of all sizes and types. Presumably his merchandise
was imported from England.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He was absent from the city between
1753 and 1760 but returned and continued in business in
the latter year.</p>

<p>Another pre-Revolution immigrant was Thomas Harland (1735-1807),
a clock maker who settled in Norwich, Connecticut, in
1773. It is claimed that he sailed from England on one of the
ships carrying the tea destroyed by the Boston Tea Party.   Over
the course of the years his business prospered to such a degree
that he hired from ten to twelve apprentices at one time. Some
of the leading American 18th-century clockmakers served apprenticeships
with Harland. In 1802 his newspaper notice stated that
he had for sale "Surveyors Compasses, with agate centre needles;
chains and Protractors ..."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A most interesting instrument that has recently come to light
is a brass sundial made in Philadelphia in 1764. The dial, about
10-1/2 inches in diameter, is signed by the maker, "Daniel Jay
Philad<sup>a</sup>. fecit." It is dated 1764 and inscribed with the name
of the person for whom it was made, "James Pemberton." In the
center is "Lat. 40," which coincides with the latitude for Philadelphia.
The style of the dial is very much in the English tradition
of the period, indicating that Jay was probably an emigrant trained
in England.</p>


<p>Post-Revolutionary Immigrant Makers</p>

<p>A large proportion of the English craftsmen who came to the
American Colonies after the Revolution settled in Philadelphia,
There was John Gould for instance, a mathematical instrument
maker from London who had opened a shop at 47 Water Street
by 1794. He sold nautical, surveying, and optical instruments
as well as mirrors, presumably all imported from England. He
moved to 70 South Front Street "At the Sign of the Quadrant"
in 1796. He was succeeded in business in 1798 by Thomas Whitney,
another emigrant from London. Whitney made and sold instruments
(see fig. 85) in Gould's former shop, and featured also a
vast array of department store merchandise. John Whitney,
who may have been his son, was listed at the same address in
the Philadelphia directory of 1801 as a "Mathematical Instrument
Maker and Optician."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the Philadelphia directory and register for 1821 Thomas
Whitney advertised that he</p>

<blockquote><p>... presents his sincere thanks to his friends and the public and respectfully
soliciting the continuation of their favors, wishes to inform them that
he has devoted his attention principally to the making of surveying compasses
for 16 years past, and has made 500 of them; the good qualities of
which are well known to many surveyors, in at least 16 of the States and
Territories of the Union ... [he also makes] many other instruments,
protractors, gunner's Calibers and quadrants, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>George Evans was another instrument maker who arrived from
London after the end of the Revolution. He established himself
in a shop at 33 North Front Street in 1796, where he sold imported
instruments as well as stationery, Bibles, and cloth. He died in
1798.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Dring, who migrated from England, settled in Westtown
Township of Chester County, Pennsylvania, where he was first
noted in the tax records of 1786. He married Hanna Griffith, a
native of the region, and their son, Jeptha Dring, subsequently
was mentioned as a carpenter by trade, and a vagrant by inclination,
who could quote Shakespeare from memory. According
to local legend, Dring raised money from a number of townspeople
for the purpose of purchasing clocks for them in England. He
set sail for his homeland in about 1798 and never returned.</p>

<p>Although the tax records for 1796 described Dring as an
"Optician" he was also a clockmaker and maker of scientific
instruments. At least three of his tall-case clocks have survived,
and a stick type of barometer which he made for Edward and
Hannah Hicks in 1796. The instrument is now in the collection
of the Chester County Historical Society. It measures 39 inches
in height, and is signed on the thermometer dial <span class="smcap">THOMAS DRING</span>/West
Chester. This instrument (fig. 14) is one of the very rare
barometers produced in America in the 18th century.</p>

<p>Another craftsman who emigrated from England was Robert
Clark, who opened a shop at 5-1/2 Church Street in Charleston,
South Carolina, in 1785.   In that year he announced himself as a</p>

<blockquote><p>Math., Optical and Philosophical Instruments maker and Clockmaker
from London ... As the Advertiser has lately had an opportunity of
working and receiving instruction under the first masters in the above
branches in Great Britain, flatters himself that he shall give satisfaction to
those who may be pleased to favor him with their orders ... for Surveyors
compasses, Quadrants, Telescopes, Microscopes, Spirit Levels, etc.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>W. Fosbrook was another craftsman originally from London.
He was a cutler and maker of surgical instruments, with a shop in
Beekman's Slip in New York City in 1786 or earlier. He specialized
in leg irons and rupture trusses, and he made instruments and
files for setting the teeth as well as standard items for surgeons.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 14.&mdash;Barometer made in 1796 by Thomas
Dring of West Chester, Pa., for Edward and
Hannah Hicks. Photo courtesy the Chester
County Historical Society.]</p>

<p>Several immigrant instrument makers established themselves
in Philadelphia during the same period. John Denegan (or
Donegan), stated to have been "late from Italy," moved his shop
in March 1787 to the corner of Race and Fourth Streets at "the
sign of the Seven Stars".<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There he made barometers and thermometers
as well as glasses for philosophical experiments. It
seems too much of a coincidence that in October 1787 an instrument
maker named Joseph Donegany established a shop at 54
Smith Street in New York City,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> where&mdash;according to an advertisement
in the October 17, 1787, issue of <i>The New York Daily
Advertiser</i>&mdash;he made "thermometers, barometers and sold hydrostatic
Bubbles and hygrometers for proving spirits, and also ...
glasses for experimental purposes." It is probable that Denegan
and Donegany were one and the same; since Denegan was stated
to have been of Italian origin, the name may originally have been
"De Negani."</p>

<p>Joseph Gatty advertised himself as an "Artist from Italy" with
a shop at 341 Pearl Street in New York City where he "made and
sold every simple and compound form of barometer and thermometer
as well as curious Hygrometers for assaying spirits which show
the actual strength with the greatest precision and are not liable to
be corroded, in addition to several new Philosophical Instruments
of his own invention, and all types of artificial fireworks."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> By
1796 Gatty (or Gatti?) had moved to Philadelphia where he had a
shop at 79 South Front Street and advertised the same items that
had appeared in his advertisements in New York. The Philadelphia
directory for 1800 listed Gatty as a "Weather Glass Maker."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>


<p>Native American Makers</p>

<p>Comparatively speaking, the greater proportion of the early
American instrument makers were native born. Among these
were to be found a substantial number of artisans trained as
clockmakers who subsequently produced scientific instruments to
meet the surveying and nautical needs of their communities.
Together with the other craftsmen throughout the colonies who
established and advertised themselves specifically as instrument
makers, they produced a large number of the mathematical
instruments used in the American Colonies in the 18th century.
A careful study of their regional distribution reveals that most
of them were concentrated in the major coastal cities of commerce.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 15.&mdash;James Wilson, first American maker of globes. From a sketch by
John Ross Dix in <i>Ballou's Pictorial Drawing Room Companion</i> (Boston, 1857),
vol. 12, p. 156.]</p>


<p><i>New Hampshire</i></p>

<p>Among the artisans who combined clockmaking with instrument
making before the beginning of the 19th century was Benjamin C.
Gilman (1763-1835) of Exeter, New Hampshire. He made mathematical
instruments and clocks in addition to working as a silversmith,
clockmaker, and hydraulic engineer.</p>


<p><i>Vermont</i></p>

<p>A New England instrument maker who had a most unusual
career was James Wilson (1763-1855) of Bradford, Vermont. He
was a native of Francestown, New Hampshire, where he was born
in a log cabin and brought up on a farm. In 1796 he purchased
his own farm, at Bradford.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 16.&mdash;Globe made by James Wilson (1763-1855) of Bradford, Vermont.
Diameter is 13 in. Photo courtesy Houghton Library, Harvard University.]</p>

<p>When a young man of 36 he saw a pair of globes at Dartmouth
College in neighboring Hanover and tried to duplicate them. He
made balls of wood turned from solid blocks, covered them with
paper, and finished them off with lines and drawings. He later
improved this method by coating the wooden balls thickly with
layers of paper pasted together. He then cut the globes into
hemispheres, removed the wooden molds, and joined the paper
shells to make the globes.</p>

<p>Wilson next proceeded to procure copper plates of the necessary
sizes for his globes, and he projected his maps on them in sections.
He received a few lessons in engraving from Amos Doolittle of
New Haven, but he was otherwise completely self-taught.</p>

<p>Wilson exhibited the first edition of his globes in Boston in 1814.
They created a sensation, and many persons asked to see the maker,
but Wilson was reluctant to come forward because of his coarse
clothing and rustic manners. He was greatly encouraged, however,
by the public interest in his work, and he continued to make
globes in Bradford (see fig. 16). In about 1815 Wilson and his
three sons, all of whom were as ingenious as the father, formed a
company to manufacture globes in Albany. There they produced
terrestrial and celestial globes, the latter showing as many as 5,000
stars. Wilson produced a new set of plates in 1826 and made
globes in several sizes. Even after he had reached the age of 83
years he constructed an excellent planetarium, engraving the large
copperplate himself.</p>

<p>Wilson was married three times and was the father of 14 children.
He died at the age of 92 in March 1855 at Bradford.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>


<p><i>Massachusetts</i></p>

<p>A surprisingly small number of the Massachusetts craftsmen
working before the end of the 18th century produced scientific
instruments. Among the very earliest were several members of
the King family of Salem. Daniel King (1704-1790) was born in
Salem on November 17, 1704. At the time of his death Rev.
William Bentley spoke of him as a "maker of Mathematical Instruments"
and a "teacher of Mathematics."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 17.&mdash;Brass surveying compass made by Stephen Greenleaf (fl. 1745) of
Boston. Photo courtesy New Hampshire Historical Society, Concord.]</p>

<p>Following Daniel's death, his business in instruments was
inherited by his son Benjamin King (1740-1804), of Salem. Benjamin
specialized in producing nautical instruments, and several
of his Davis quadrants have survived in public collections. When
he died on December 26, 1804, Reverend Bentley wrote that King
was " ... a Mathematical Instrument maker, in that branch which
immediately regarded practical navigation by quadrant and
compass. He supported a very good character through life &amp;
was much esteemed."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Another of the very early mathematical instrument makers in
Massachusetts was Stephen Greenleaf (see fig. 17), who kept a shop
on Queen Street opposite the prison in Boston where</p>

<blockquote><p>He makes and Mends all Sorts of Mathematical Instruments, as Theodolites,
Spirit Levels, Semicircles, Circumferences, and Protractors, Horizontal
and Equinoctial Sun Dials, Azimuth and Amplitude Compasses, Elliptical
and Triangular Compasses, and all sorts of Common Compasses ... N.B.
He sets Load Stones on Silver or Brass, after the best manner.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Dakin worked as a mathematical balance-maker "at
the Sign of the Hand &amp; Beam, opposite to Dr. Colman's Meeting
House" where he made a variety of scale beams in 1745.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>An interesting advertisement by Rowland Houghton appeared
in the January 17-24, 1737, issue of the <i>Boston Gazette</i>. Houghton
announced that he had "lately improv'd on his new Theodolite,
by which the Art of Surveying is rendered more plain &amp; easy than
heretofore." Houghton was active in the political scene in Boston,
as evidenced by the fact that in various issues of the <i>Boston
Gazette</i> for January and February 1739 he is listed variously as
"Commissioner," "Proprietors' Clerk" and as "Collector."</p>

<p>Isaac Greenwood, Jr. (1730-1803), was born at Cambridge,
where he married Mary I'ams in 1757. He maintained a shop
where he combined the business of mathematical instrument
maker and ivory turner, and also imported hardware. After the
Revolution, he engaged in dentistry, specializing in making artificial
teeth and in the manufacture of "umbrilloes." Paul Revere
apparently did printing for him on five different occasions between
1762 and 1774, and in about 1771 engraved his trade card, which
read:</p>

<blockquote><p>ISAAC GREENWOOD, Ivory Turner Next door to Doctor John Clark's
at the North End Boston. Turns all sorts of work in Ivory, Silver, Brass,
Iron, Horn, Wood, etc. Such as Billiard Balls, Tea Boards, Scallop<sup>d</sup> and
Plain Salvers, Decanters ...<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Isaac's father, Isaac Greenwood, Sr., was "Professor of Mathematicks
and Natural and Experimental Philosophy" at Harvard.
In the <i>Boston Gazette</i> for February 19-26, 1728, there appeared
the following notice of his installation:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 13th of this Month at Ten in the Morning, The Honorable &amp; Reverend
Overseers of the College at Cambridge, met the Corporation in the
College Hall, to Inaugurate Mr. Isaac Greenwood into the Office of Professor
of the Mathematicks, and Natural and Experimental Philosophy, lately
founded by that great and living Benefactor to this Society, Mr. Thomas
Hollis of London Merchant. The Rev. President being detain'd by illness,
Mr. Flint the Senior Fellow perform'd the part of Moderator, began with
Prayer, and then Pronounc'd a Latin Oration proper to the Occasion: Mr.
Wiggleworth Divinity Professor, read the Founders Instructions. Mr.
Greenwood took the Oaths and made the Declarations required in them:
and pronounc'd a Latin Oration. The Rev. Mr. Appleton Pray'd: and
Singing part of the 104 Psalm concluded the Solemnity. After which the
Overseers &amp; Corporation repair'd to the Library; till the Publick Dinner in
the Hall was ready, where all the Gentlemen Spectators of the Solemnity
were hansomely Entertained.</p></blockquote>

<p>Greenwood continued to teach privately for a decade. In various
issues of <i>The Boston Gazette</i> of 1738 and 1739 he featured an advertisement,
the text of which always stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>Such as are desirous of learning any Part of Practical or Theoretical
Mathematics may be taught by Isaac Greenwood, A.M. &amp;c. in Clark's Square,
near the North Meeting House, where Attendance will be given between the
Hours of 9 and 12 in the Forenoon, and 2 and 5 in the Afternoons.</p>

<p>N.B. Instructions may also be had in any Branch of Natural Philosophy,
when there is a sufficient Number to attend.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>John Bailey II (1752-1823) of Hanover and Lynn, Massachusetts
worked as a clockmaker from about 1770. His father,
John Bailey I, and his brothers Calvin and Lebbeus also were
clockmakers. Bailey married Mary Hall of Berwick, Maine,
and settled in Hanover where he made scientific instruments and
clocks. A brass surveying compass in the collection of the New
York Historical Society is inscribed "<span class="smcap">J. BAILEY HANOVER</span> 1804."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best known instrument maker in Massachusetts
was Joseph Pope (1750-1826), of Boston, who was described
by contemporaries as the "local mathematician, watch-maker and
mechanical genius." In 1787 he completed the construction of a
gear-driven orrery displaying the motions of the solar system in
a horizontal plane with eccentric and inclined orbits. At each
of the twelve corners were mounted cast bronze figures, claimed
to have been carved in wood by Simeon Skillin and cast in bronze
by Paul Revere. Although the instrument was made for Harvard,
the university lacked funds for its purchase. Accordingly, it held
a public lottery which realized a substantial sum in excess of
the £450.3.0 paid to Pope, and the orrery was delivered in December
1788.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The orrery (fig. 18) has survived and is part of
the collection of historical scientific instruments at Harvard
University.</p>

<p>According to a statement in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> for February 16,
1789, an apparatus for displaying planets in their proper orbits
by means of wires was made and exhibited in Boston by Bartholomew
Burges.</p>

<p>Mention must also be made of several members of the Folger
family of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Peter Folger (1617-1690),
founder of the American branch of the family, emigrated from
Norfolk, England, in 1635 and occupied himself in Nantucket as
blacksmith, schoolmaster, watchmaker, and surveyor. He was
a grandfather of Benjamin Franklin. Another notable descendant
was Maria Mitchell (1818-1889), professor of astronomy and
director of the observatory at Vassar College.</p>

<p>The best known member of the family was Walter Folger, Jr.
(1765-1849), a self-taught clockmaker and watchmaker with great
interest in the sciences. A telescope that he produced about 1818
was considered to be the finest in the country at that time. His
greatest achievement was a tall case astronomical clock that he
devised and constructed; it was completed in 1790 and is considered
to be the most complicated domestic clock on record.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Folger also produced quadrants and compasses, and made astronomical
observations. His observations of the solar eclipse of
September 17, 1811, were published in 1815 in <i>Memoirs of the
Academy of Arts and Sciences</i>.</p>

<p>Probably one of the most significant of the surviving early
American scientific instruments is a pair of gunners' calipers made
and used by <span class="smcap">PAUL REVERE</span> (1735-1818) of Boston. The calipers
are made of incised brass, measuring 7 inches in length and 1-3/4
inches in width. They are signed on the reverse side with the
name "Revere" in the style of script signature used by this
maker in many of his engravings. The design of the instrument
is substantially different from that which is commonly found in
English, French, and German gunners' calipers of the period, and
was probably Revere's own. (See figs. 19, 20.)</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 18.&mdash;Orrery by Joseph Pope completed in 1787 for Harvard University.
Engraved plates and bronze figures were made by Paul Revere. The orrery
is 6-1/2 ft. in diameter and 6-1/2 ft. high. The twelve figures at the corners are
said to have been carved in wood by Simeon Skillin and cast in bronze by
Paul Revere. Photo courtesy Harvard University.]</p>

<p>It is believed that these calipers, which are preserved in the
collection of the Bostonian Society in Boston, were probably used
by Revere in 1775-1776. This was the period during which he
was in charge of ordnance repairs for the Continental Army, and
involved in various ventures for the manufacture of gunpowder
and the casting of cannon. There is no evidence of other scientific
instruments made by Revere, lending some weight to the belief
that these calipers were made for his own use.</p>

<p>Other Massachusetts instrument makers include Gideon Fairman
(1774-1827) of Newburyport who was a partner of William Hooker
in the firm of Hooker &amp; Fairman, which dealt in mathematical
instruments before 1810.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>    Fairman later moved to Philadelphia,
where he was associated with the engraving firm of Draper,
Murray &amp; Fairman.</p>

<p>At the end of the 18th century Samuel Emery was making
mathematical instruments in Salem, at the same time that John
Jayne was engaged in the same work in that community.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>John Potter of Brookfield, Massachusetts, produced surveying
instruments in the last quarter of the 18th century. A graphometer
signed with his name and dated 1785 is in the collection
of the firm of W. &amp; L. E. Gurley in Troy, New York.</p>


<p><i>Rhode Island</i></p>

<p>One of the earliest and most important of the instrument makers
of Rhode Island was Benjamin King (1707-1786), of Newport.
He was the son of Capt. Samuel King of Salem, Massachusetts,
where he was born and baptized on March 13, 1707. He was a
brother of Daniel King of Salem. Benjamin eventually moved
to Newport, where he married Mary Hagger in July 1742. They
had four children: Benjamin, Mehitable, Samuel, and Mary.
He established himself as a respectable businessman in the community,
and in 1759 or 1760 he became the senior partner in the
importing and retailing firm of King &amp; Hagger, "near the sign
of Mr. Pitt," dealing in general merchandise, mathematical and
nautical instruments, and stationery. William Hagger was
probably the junior partner, and may have been King's brother-in-law.
King began making his own instruments for sale, surviving
examples dated as early as 1762. The partnership was
dissolved early in the 1760's. In 1766 Benjamin King was
importing, making, and selling quadrants and other instruments
"At the Sign of the Mathematical Instruments" next to the
Golden Eagle on Thames Street. His son Samuel King occupied
the same premises, where he dealt in paints and artists supplies.</p>

<p>When the British occupied Newport, King moved to North
Kingstown, but he returned after the British vacated the city.
He was 79 when he died in 1786, and his son Samuel King succeeded
him in business.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>William Guyse Hagger (c. 1744-1830?), born in Newport, is believed
to have been the son of William Hagar and Mary Knowlton.
He was a quadrant maker (see fig. 21).    In 1774 he headed a
household that consisted of his wife, five children, and a colored servant.
Whether it was he or his father who was the partner of Benjamin
King cannot be determined with certainty. When Newport was
occupied by the British, Hagger moved to Cranston, where he
joined the Pawtuxet Rangers and served as a sentinel at Pawtuxet
Fort in 1778. No members of the Hagger family appear in the
1790 census of Newport, but a William Hager is reported as having
died in Boston in 1830 at the age of 82. It seems likely from the
age and dates that it was William Hagger the elder who worked as
a partner in the firm of King &amp; Hagger, which was established in
1759 or 1760.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 21.&mdash;Davis quadrant or backstaff made and signed by William Guyse
Hagger of Newport, Rhode Island, about 1760-1770. USNM 319029.]</p>

<p>Another instrument maker of Rhode Island was William Hamlin
(1772-1869). He had established himself in Providence by the
beginning of the 19th century in the manufacturing and repairing
of mathematical and nautical instruments, for which there was an
active market in that city. Hamlin was one of the first engravers
in America and the first in Rhode Island. He designed and engraved
banknotes for many banks in the State and for other institutions.
At the same time he carried on a general trade in the
sale of musical instruments. Hamlin moved his shop several times,
but from 1847 until his death he worked at "The Sign of the
Quadrant" (see fig. 22) at 131 South Water Street. He was
equally interested in optics and astronomy, and it has been claimed
that he constructed the first telescope in America. It is well
established that he worked for many years to perfect a reflecting
telescope for his own use.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Instruments were made also by Paul Pease, who may have been
the husband of the daughter of Nathaniel Folger of Nantucket.
This Elizabeth Folger Pease, wife of a Paul Pease, was born in 1720
and died in 1795. Little is known about Pease except for the name
"Paul Pease 1750" inscribed on a quadrant in the collection of the
Rhode Island Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<p><i>Connecticut</i></p>

<p>The clockmakers who worked in Connecticut during the span
of the 18th century numbered almost a hundred. Yet only a half
dozen appear on record to have made or sold instruments in addition
to clocks. Among these were several members of the Doolittle
family, including Isaac Doolittle (1721-1800) of New Haven.
In 1763 he advertised that he sold surveying compasses in addition
to clocks, watches, bar iron, and chocolate.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> His son Isaac
Doolittle, Jr. (1759-1821), also of New Haven, established a shop
of his own, which he advertised in 1781 as having</p>

<blockquote><p>Compasses of all kinds, both for sea and land, surveyors scales, and protractors,
gauging rods, walking sticks, silver and plated buttons, turned upon
horn; also clocks and watches made and repaired ...<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although not very active as a clockmaker, Isaac Jr. appears to
have specialized more in the production of surveying and nautical
instruments. He took over his father's business just before the
latter's death, and in 1799 he advertised<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:</p>

<p>Enos Doolittle (1751-1806), a nephew of Isaac Doolittle, Sr.,
made, sold, cleaned, and repaired clocks and surveying and marine
compasses from 1772 through 1788 at his shop in Hartford. He
also sold these items through agents in Saybrook and Middleton.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>One of the best known of the Connecticut clockmakers was
Peregrine White (1747-1834), of Woodstock. White was a
descendant of the first Pilgrim child, and a native of Boston.
After serving an apprenticeship, he worked as a clockmaker
and silversmith in Boston. He was accused of forging silver
spoons and left the city to settle in Woodstock. He established
his own shop west of Muddy Brook Village.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In addition to
fine tall-case clocks, for which he was noted, White also produced
surveying compasses, one of which is in the collection of the U.S.
National Museum (fig. 23). A similar specimen in Old Sturbridge
Village is reputed to have been used for surveying the town
of Southbridge, Mass.</p>

<p>Benjamin Hanks (1755-1824), of Mansfield and Litchfield, inserted
a notice in a newspaper in 1808 to notify the public that he
and his son Truman Hanks, in partnership, had "surveyors compasses
upon the Rittenhouse improved plan" in addition to such
other commodities as brass cannon, bells from their own foundry,
clocks, goldsmith's items, and stocking looms.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Ziba Blakslee (1768-1834), of Newton, worked as a clockmaker,
goldsmith, and bell founder and he advertised that he made and
sold surveying instruments.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In New Haven, Clark Sibley and Simeon Marble organized the
firm of Sibley &amp; Marble and advertised that in addition to repairing
swords and cutlasses, clocks and watches, they also repaired
mathematical and surgical instruments.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>One of the instrument makers of New England who has remained
relatively unknown was Benjamin Platt (1757-1833), who was
born in Danbury, Connecticut, on January 3, 1757.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He married
Adah Fairchild of the same city in 1776, and it is believed that he
must have completed his apprenticeship by that date inasmuch as
apprentices usually were not allowed to marry.</p>

<p>It is not known how long Platt worked in his native city, but by
1780 he had moved to Litchfield, where he worked in gold, silver,
and brass. He became established as a clockmaker and produced
tall case clocks and other types. In 1787 he was in New Milford, a
town adjacent to Danbury, where he produced surveying compasses
(see fig. 24). Three years later, in 1790, he was at Milford, where
he invented a "Compass for measuring distance in hilly country."
In 1793 he returned to New Milford, where he made a clock to
order for Eli Todd, and by 1800 he had moved to Lanesboro,
Massachusetts.</p>


<p><i>Ohio</i></p>

<p>Benjamin Platt was the migratory type. In 1817 he migrated
from Lanesboro to Columbus, Ohio. His son, Augustus Platt
(1793-1886), also made mathematical instruments (see fig. 25) in
Columbus. In 1809 a grandson, named William Augustus Platt
was born. When the child's mother died, Benjamin and Adah
Platt adopted the boy, and when he came of age he went into the
watchmaking trade. William Platt married Fanny Hayes, sister
of President Hayes.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> His shop was listed in the 1843 city directory;
it was the first jewelry and clock and watch store in the
community.</p>

<p>An interesting account of instrument making in Ohio is found
in the report of a missionary, John Heckewelder. He mentioned
the brothers Joseph and Francois Devacht who worked as watchmakers
and instrument makers in Gallipolis, Ohio. Writing in
1792, Heckewelder stated that "the most interesting shops of
the Workmen [in Gallipolis] were those of the Goldsmiths and
Watchmakers. They showed us work on watches, compasses,
sundials finer than I have ever beheld."</p>

<p><i>New York</i></p>

<p>There were relatively few makers of mathematical instruments
in New York City before the end of the 18th century. Perhaps
the earliest was John Bailey, who moved from Fredericksburg,
Virginia, to Fishkill, New York, in 1778. He was a cutler by trade,
and he made and sold surgical instruments.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>"Bulmain &amp; Dennies" at 59 Water Street in New York were the
appointed agents to sell the "Perpetual Log or Distance Clock to
find a ship's way at sea." The device had been patented in the
United States, and one of the instruments was displayed at the bar
of the Tontine Coffee House, according to an advertisement in the
July 23, 1799, issue of the <i>New York Gazette and General Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>H. Caritat, at 153 Broadway in New York, imported and sold
"The Planispherical Planetarium." This item was described in an
advertisement<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> as "a graphic representation of the earth, in twelve
particular positions during its revolutionary course around the sun,
as also of the Moon's revolution around the earth, together with
literal description of parts and motions, etc." The advertisement
also stated that Caritat sold "Carey's newly improved Terrestrial
and Celestial Globes which omitted the Constellary Configurations."</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 25.&mdash;Surveying theodolite made by Augustus Platt (1793-1886) of Columbus,
Ohio, in the early 19th century. Photo courtesy Ohio State Museum.]</p>

<p>In 1785 M. Morris of New York City made and sold his own
invention of a "Nautical Protractor for the price of One Dollar."
In an advertisement in <i>The Independent Journal or the General
Advertiser</i> of May 25, 1785, he explained that the device was for
use in the construction of globular maps and Mercator charts.
He also made another protractor for attaching to the end of a ruler
for measuring distances on charts. He planned to publish a
treatise on the subject of his inventions.</p>

<p>James Youle, a cutler and mechanician with a shop located first
on Fly Street and then at 64 Water Street "at the Sign of the Cross-Knives
and Gun," sold a large variety of cutlery and hardware
for gun repair. He also made surgical instruments. He died in
February 1786 at the age of 46 as the result of an injury to his chest
from a breaking grindstone while working in his shop. He was
survived by a widow and nine children and was succeeded in business
by his son John Youle.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>


<p><i>New Jersey</i></p>

<p>One of the few instrument makers known to have worked in
New Jersey was Aaron Miller of "Elizabeth-town." He was first
noted in the New York newspapers in 1748 when he notified the
public that, in addition to clocks, he made compasses, chains for
surveyors, and church bells, for which he maintained his own
foundry. When he died in 1771 he left all his tools to a son-in-law,
Isaac Brokaw.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Another craftsman who is entitled to being included as an
instrument maker was Richard Wistar. When Casper Wistar
died in 1752, his son Richard succeeded him as owner of the famous
glass works. In addition to window glass and glassware, Richard
Wistar also produced such special products as retorts for use in
chemistry and "electerizing globes and tubes," as well as bottles
for Leyden jars that Benjamin Franklin had urged him to attempt
in the early 1750's.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>


<p><i>Delaware</i></p>

<p>George Crow (ca. 1725-1771/72) of Wilmington, Delaware,
was apparently well established as a clockmaker in the community
by the time of his marriage in 1746 to Mary Laudonet. They had
four children, and Crow's two sons followed his trade. George
Crow was active in civic affairs, and in addition to clocks, he
produced surveying compasses, several of which have survived.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>


<p><i>Maryland and Virginia</i></p>

<p>Brief mention has already been made of the Chandlee family of
clockmakers and instrument makers of the 18th century. The
founder of the line and first of interest was Benjamin Chandlee, Sr.,
who migrated in 1702 from Ireland to Philadelphia, where he was
apprenticed to Abel Cottey, clockmaker, and eventually married
his daughter. His son Benjamin Chandlee, Jr. (1723-1791),
worked as a clockmaker in Nottingham, Maryland, where he
produced instruments as well as clocks. A fine example of a brass
surveying compass&mdash;inscribed with his name, and which is believed
to have been made for the Gilpin family in about 1761&mdash;is on
exhibition in the Chester County Historical Society. He had four
sons, and a few years before his death he established the firm of
Chandlee &amp; Sons, the name of which was changed to Ellis Chandlee
&amp; Brothers a year before he died.</p>

<p>The oldest of Benjamin Jr.'s four sons was Goldsmith Chandlee
(c.1746-1821). After serving an apprenticeship with his father,
Goldsmith moved to Virginia and worked near Stephensburg (now
Stephens City). He eventually established himself at Winchester
and built a brass foundry and a shop where he produced clocks,
surveying compasses, sundials, apothecary and money scales,
surgical instruments, compasses, telescopes, and other items in
metal. Numerous examples of his clocks and instruments have
survived. Their fine quality attests to the claim that he was one of
the foremost craftsmen of the 18th century. Several of his surveying
compasses exist in modern collections. An instrument (fig. 26)
that he made about 1794 for a surveyor named Robert Lyle is in
the writer's collection; an almost identical instrument that Chandlee
made for Lawrence Augustine Washington, George Washington's
nephew, is exhibited in the library at Mount Vernon,
Virginia.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 26.&mdash;The label of Goldsmith Chandlee. In the collection of Ohio Historical
Society, Ohio State Museum.]</p>

<p>Ellis Chandlee (1755-1816) also was apprenticed to his father,
and he worked with his brothers in the shop. He established the
firm of Ellis Chandlee &amp; Brothers, in 1790, shortly before his
father's death. The firm was dissolved in 1797 when the youngest
brother, John Chandlee, left the firm. Ellis continued in partnership
with his other brother, Isaac Chandlee (1760-1813), until
about 1804, producing clocks, surveying instruments, and other
metal articles. Their products were signed "Ellis and Isaac
Chandlee, Nottingham," or, in the case of a surveying compass in
the collection of the Chester County Historical Society, "E. &amp; I.
Chandlee, Nottingham." Isaac Chandlee also produced clocks
and instruments under his own name only, for there are a number
of surviving clocks and surveying compasses signed in such manner
(see fig. 28).<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>One of the most important craftsmen of Maryland was Frederick
A. Heisely (1759-1839). A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
he served an apprenticeship there with John Hoff, the master clockmaker,
from 1777 to 1783. Heisely served in the Revolution. In
1783, presumably upon the completion of his apprenticeship, he
married Catherine Hoff, the clockmaker's daughter. He moved to
Frederick, Maryland, where he established his own clockmaking
shop and where he specialized in making mathematical instruments.
A tower clock made in Frederick is in the collection of the U.S.
National Museum. Heisely returned to Lancaster to become
Hoff's partner, and worked with him until 1802. He then moved
his shop to Harrisburg and worked there until 1820. He moved
once more, this time to Pittsburgh where he advertised himself as
a "Clock, Watch and Instrument Maker," with a shop at No. 6
St. Clair Street.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 28.&mdash;Brass surveying compass made by Goldsmith Chandlee for Laurence
Augustine Washington in about 1795. In the library at Mount Vernon.

<p>George Heisely (1789-1880), Frederick's son, who was born at
Frederick, Maryland, achieved note in his own right as a maker of
clocks and instruments. He worked at Second and Walnut
Streets in Harrisburg. He is credited with being the person who
selected the melody of "To Anacreon in Heaven" for "The Star-Spangled
Banner," while he was serving as a member of the Pennsylvania
State Militia.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>


<p><i>Pennsylvania</i></p>

<p>A number of instrument makers worked in Philadelphia, which
was one of the important shipping centers during the 18th century
and consequently one of the important markets for nautical
instruments.</p>

<p>Probably the earliest Philadelphia instrument maker of record
was Thomas Godfrey (1704-1749) who was born in Bristol Township.
After serving an apprenticeship, Godfrey developed his
own business as a glazier and plumber. He is stated to have done
the major part of the glazing of the State House in 1732, as well
as similar work on Christ Church. He also worked for Andrew
Hamilton and for James Logan.</p>

<p>Godfrey had a natural inclination and interest in science and
mathematics, which may have been further encouraged by his
friendship with Benjamin Franklin, who resided in the same
house. Godfrey was also a fellow member of Franklin's Junto.</p>

<p>In 1730 Godfrey invented an improved backstaff or Davis
quadrant, and loaned the instrument to Joshua Fisher to be used
in the latter's survey of Delaware Bay. It is claimed that the
location of Cape Henlopen was established on Fisher's map (published
in London in 1756) by means of Godfrey's instrument.
James Logan became interested in the improved backstaff invented
by Godfrey and at Logan's request, the instrument was
taken on a voyage to the West Indies by a Captain Wright for the
purpose of testing it.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Logan sent a description of the instrument
to London to the Royal Astronomer, Edmund Halley. No acknowledgment
was made, and in 1734 Logan sent a second description
to Sir Hans Sloane and to Peter Collison for forwarding to the
Royal Society. The arrival of this description coincided with
the submission of the description of a similar instrument to the
Society by its vice president, James Hadley. The Royal Society
decided in favor of both inventors, and Godfrey was awarded the
equivalent of 200 pounds in household furniture.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 29.&mdash;Brass surveying compass made by Isaac Chandlee (1760-1813) of
Nottingham, Maryland. Photo courtesy Ohio State Museum.]</p>

<p>Godfrey is often confused with his son, also named Thomas
Godfrey (1736-1763), who worked as a watchmaker in Philadelphia,
and subsequently became active in literary arts.</p>

<p>Benjamin Condy (fl. 1756-1792, d. 1798) was an instrument
maker with a shop on South Front Street in Philadelphia. As early
as 1756 he worked for most of the merchant shippers of the port,
supplying them with a considerable number of sand glasses that
ranged from the quarter-minute to the two-hour varieties. Although
he made his own mathematical instruments, it is likely
that he imported the sand glasses. According to Customs House
clearances of 1789, he had imported from London on the ship
<i>Pigou</i> "three cases of merchandise" valued at £160/17/6 with a
duty of $32.19, which may have included sand glasses.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>When Condy retired in 1792 he was succeeded in business by
Thomas Biggs at the same address. Biggs had originally served
an apprenticeship with Condy, and then fought for the American
cause in the Revolution for five years. Following the termination
of his military service he had engaged in instrument making in
New York for eight years before returning to Philadelphia, his
native city. Biggs prospered and his advertisements continued
until early in 1795.</p>

<p>Thomas Pryor made instruments in a shop on Chestnut Street
in 1778, but he evidently retired from business in the 1790's because
the city directory of 1795 listed him merely as "gentleman."
He is reported to have been one of those who, from the State
House Yard, witnessed the transit of Venus.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Among the early makers of mathematical instruments in Philadelphia
was William Dean (?-1797), who is believed to have been
working in that city as early as 1778. His name first appears in
local directories in June 1792, where his shop address was listed as
No. 43 South Front Street. Later he advertised that he made and
sold "Surveying instruments&mdash;Telescopes, Sextants, Quadrants&mdash;and
every article requisite for navigation, surveying, levelling,
&amp;c...."</p>

<p>According to details which were noted in his last will, which was
dated June 1, 1797, and filed and proved in the following month,
Dean's death appears to have been preceded by a long illness.
He designated his two sisters as his executrices, and the fact
that his will specified the appointment of a Mr. Thomas Yardley,
Jr., as guardian of his three children indicates that he may have
been a widower at the time of his death.</p>

<p>A surveying compass by this maker was recently brought to
light in, the Clark County Historical Society, Springfield, Ohio,
by Dr. Donald A. Hutzlar of the Ohio State Museum. The
instrument is a plain compass in brass without levels, 13-1/2 inches
in length, and with a 5-inch needle. The dial is marked "<span class="smcap">DEAN
PHILAD</span><sup>a</sup>." The wooden cover for the instrument is marked
with the names of previous owners and dates, as follows:</p>

<p>
Jno. C. Symes, Aug. 10, 1778<br />
I. Ludlow, 1791<br />
Henry Donnel, July 24, 1794<br />
Jonathan Donnel, 1796<br />
John Dyherty<br />
Thomas J. Kizer, 1838<br />
David J. Kizer, '78.<br />
</p>

<p>A description of this instrument in "<i>The History of Clark County,
Ohio</i>" by A. P. Steele, published in 1881 by the W. H. Beers Co.
of Chicago, adds considerably to its interest as a historical record
of American scientific instruments and their use: "Col. Thomas
Kizer, the veteran surveyor, has in his possession a compass
made by Dean of Philadelphia; this instrument was owned and
used by his father, David Kizer, who obtained it from John
Dougherty about 1813; Dougherty got it from Jonathan Donnel.
This relic is marked I. Ludlow, 1791; Henry Donnel, 1794; J.
Donnel, 1796, John Dougherty, 1799; these marks are rudely
scratched upon the cover of the instrument, and bear every evidence
of being genuine; there is no doubt but that this old compass
was used in making the first surveys in this county, or that it
is the identical instrument used by John Dougherty, in laying
off Demint's first plat of Springfield, and by Jonathan Donnel
on the survey of 'New Boston.'" It is to be noted that some
discrepancies exist in the listing of names and dates of the previous
owners between Steele's <i>History</i> and those which actually appear
on the cover of the instrument. Steele apparently made the
changes he deemed necessary in his account of the instrument.</p>

<p>Between 1791 and 1795 the same address was also occupied
by a cooper named Michael Davenport, and from 1797 to 1801 by
"the Widow Davenport," presumably widow of Michael. From
1802 to 1804 the same address is listed for William Davenport,
"Mathematical Instrument Maker," apprentice to William
Dean, and believed to be the son of Michael. During the next
ten years Davenport's address was 45 South Front Street, and
then, to 1820, was 25 South Front Street.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Several brass surveying
compasses bearing his name have survived.</p>

<p>Another maker of mathematical instruments about whom
nothing further is known is Charles Taws, who was listed in this
manner in the Philadelphia directory of 1795.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 30.&mdash;Brass  surveying compass  marked "F. Heisely Fred:*town." In
collection of Ohio Historical Society, Ohio State Museum.]</p>

<p>The making of instruments in glass appears to have been a
specialized business in the Colonies, because those who worked in
this field do not appear to have produced instruments in other
materials. One of these makers of glass instruments&mdash;specifically
barometers, thermometers and "Glass Bubbles to prove spirits,
of different kinds"&mdash;was Alloysius Ketterer. He maintained a
shop in the house of a Charles Kugler at "the sign of the Seven
Stars," corner of Race and Fourth Streets in Philadelphia, in
1789. He moved to another address in Race Street in 1790 and
was eventually succeeded in business by Martin Fisher, who
increased the number of types of glass instruments made and
sold at the shop.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Henry Voight (1738-1814) was a man with a varied career. Of
German ancestry, he was trained as a clock-and watchmaker, and
he was a skilled mechanic. He operated a wire mill in Reading,
Pennsylvania, in 1780 and moved shortly thereafter to Philadelphia,
where he established a clockmaker's shop on Second Street. He
became a close friend of the inventor John Fitch in about 1786, and
in the following year he became a shareholder in Fitch's company
for producing steamboats. In 1792 he entered into a short-lived
partnership with Fitch to manufacture steam engines. In 1793
he invented a process for making steel from bar iron. In the same
year President Washington appointed Voight to the position of
chief coiner of the Philadelphia Mint, and he continued in that
position until his death in 1814. He was closely associated with
David Rittenhouse, Andrew Ellicott, Edward Duffield, and others.</p>

<p>Although there is no record of Voight's career as an instrument
maker, there is nevertheless some evidence that he worked in that
field. In the collection of the U.S. National Museum there is a
brass equal-altitude telescope (fig. 31) made about 1790, that is
signed "Henry Voigt." His name was spelled "Voigt" and
"Voight" interchangeably.</p>

<p>Henry's son Thomas Voight worked as a clockmaker on North
Seventh Street in Philadelphia around 1811. He was the maker of
a tall case clock, ordered by Thomas Jefferson, that Jefferson's
daughter presented in 1826 to her father's physician, Dr. Dunglison,
for settlement of medical services.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>There were several instrument makers in provincial Pennsylvania,
but the majority of such craftsmen worked in Philadelphia.
Dr. Christopher Witt (1675-1765), an emigrant from England,
worked in Germantown from about 1710 to 1765. He was well
known locally as a medical doctor, scientist, "hexmeister", clockmaker,
and teacher. It is traditionally claimed that he produced
mathematical instruments in addition to timepieces. He described
the great comet of 1743 and built his own 8-foot telescope. One of
his apprentices may have been Christopher Sower (1693-1740), of
Germantown and Philadelphia, who achieved renown as a doctor,
farmer, author, printer, papermaker, and clockmaker. He also
produced mathematical instruments.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>George Wall, Jr., of Bucks County, was the author of a pamphlet
on the subject of "a newly invented Surveying Instrument, called
the Trigonometer." The instrument was described and illustrated
in the pamphlet, which was published in Philadelphia in 1788.
Washington's own copy, bearing the inscription "To the President
of the United States from the Author" is in the collection of the
Boston Athenaeum.</p>

<p>George Ford of Lancaster maintained a shop on West King
Street, probably from the end of the 18th century until 1840.
There he made tall case and other clocks, surveying compasses,
and other instruments for the retail trade. However, he "did not
push the business of Watchmaking and Clockmaking so hard, for
the manufacture of nautical instruments and surveyors instruments
was a more important part of his business."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Upon his
death in 1842 he was succeeded by his son George Ford II.</p>

<p>Thomas Mendenhall repaired clocks and mathematical instruments
in a shop on King and Queen Streets in the borough of
Lancaster in 1775.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>John Wood of Philadelphia was a wholesale supplier of parts for
clockmakers and watchmakers. According to a notice in the May
7, 1790, issue of <i>Pennsylvania Packet</i>, he had "pocket compasses,
steel magnets, Surveying compass needles, surveyors chains, etc."
Since no mention was made of making or mending instruments, it
is probable that Wood was merely importer and wholesaler.</p>

<p>Another instrument maker of Philadelphia about whom little
is known is Bryan Gilmur, who worked at the close of the 18th
century making instruments and, possibly, clocks.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>James Jacks (also listed as James Jack) first worked as clockmaker
and watchmaker in Charleston, South Carolina, in the
1780's; he later moved to Philadelphia where he maintained a shop
on Market Street where he sold a variety of instruments. In the
June 5, 1797, issue of <i>The Federal Gazette</i> he announced that, in
addition to jewelry, clocks and watches, he "also had for sale
mathematical instruments in cases very compleat; Surveyors Compasses
and Theodolites; ship's Quadrants; Fishing Rods and Reels;
Billiard Balls and sheet ivory; silver and plated coach, chaise and
chair Whips."</p>

<p>The Use of Wood</p>


<p>An interesting fact concerning the instruments produced by
18th-century craftsmen is the relatively high incidence of instruments
constructed of wood instead of brass or other metals. A
significant reference to this use of wood is found in Alexander
Hamilton's "Report on the Subject of Manufactures," published
in 1821,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which refers to such items of wood as "Ships, cabinet-wares
and turnery, wool and cotton cards, and other machinery
for manufactures and husbandry, mathematical instruments," ...
and "coopers' wares of every kind."</p>

<p>Most common of these mathematical instruments is the surveying
compass, possibly the instrument most needed and produced
in America. Recorded in public and private collections are
31 known examples of such compasses made of wood, a rather
large number. Furthermore, a substantial number of these were
being produced simultaneously by skilled craftsmen who at the
same time were making similar instruments in brass.</p>

<p>Finally, from a study of the surviving examples of wooden
surveying compasses comes the interesting and perhaps significant
fact that all the known makers were from New England. The
towns and cities in which they worked were Boston and Plymouth
in Massachusetts, Windsor and New Milford in Connecticut, and
Walpole and Portsmouth in New Hampshire. A careful study of
the advertisements and works of the instrument makers in the other
large cities of the Colonies, such as New York, Baltimore, and
Philadelphia, reveals no examples of wooden scientific instruments.
Excluded, of course, are those instruments normally made of wood,
such as the octant and the mariners quadrant.</p>

<p>Two possible exceptions are instrument makers of New York
City. The first is James Ham, a maker of mathematical instruments
"at the house wherein the Widow Ratsey lately lived
near the Old Dutch Church on Smith Street" who advertised in
the May 27, 1754, issue of <i>The New York Mercury</i> that he made
and sold</p>

<blockquote><p>mathematical instruments in wood, brass, or ivory, theodolites, circumferentors,
sectors, parallel rules, protractors, plain scales, and dividers, the
late instrument called an Octant, Davis' quadrants, gauging rods, sliding and
gunter's scales, amplitude wood box and hanging and pocket compasses, surveying
chains, japanned telescopes, dice and dice boxes, mariners compasses
and kalenders, etc.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Ham subsequently moved his business to Philadelphia where he
first advertised in 1764, stating that he worked at the sign of
"Hadley's Quadrant" at Front and Water Streets in Philadelphia
and sold all forms of instruments in silver, brass, and ivory as well
as "large brass pocket dials, fitted to the latitude of Philadelphia."
In 1780 his son James Ham, Jr., advertised from the same address
as a maker of mathematical instruments, specializing in "Hadley
and Davis Quadrants."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The second exception is William Hinton, who advertised in <i>The
New York Gazette and the Weekly Mercury</i> of May 4, 1772, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>WILLIAM HINTON, Mathematical Instrument Maker, at Hadley's
Quadrant, facing the East Side of the New Coffee House, Makes and sells
all sorts of Mathematical Instruments, in Silver, Brass, Ivory or Wood,
viz. Hadley's Quadrants, Davis's do. Crostaf's Nocturnals, Gunters Scales,
Plotting do. Cases of Instruments, Surveyors Chains, Dividers with and
without Points, Protractors, paralelled Rulers, Rods for Guaging, Amplitude,
hanging and common Wood Compasses, Pocket do. three Foot Telescopes,
Pocket do. Backgammon Tables, Dice and Dice Boxes, Billiard Balls and
Tacks, Violin Bows and Bridges; with a Variety of other Articles too tedious
to mention: And as he is a young Beginner, he flatters himself, he shall meet
with Encouragement; and all those who please to favour him with their
Custom, may depend upon having their Work done in the neatest and best
Manner, and at reasonable Rates.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is mentioned that both Ham and Hinton worked in wood in
addition to other materials, but it appears very likely that the
use of wood referred specifically to those instruments normally
made of wood, such as quadrants and octants, and not to other
instruments.</p>

<p>Any attempt to relate the making of wooden scientific instruments
with the production of wooden clocks in New England has
no conclusive result, yet there appears to be some relationship
between the two. Wooden clocks were made as early as the 17th
century in Germany and Holland, and they were known in England
in the early 18th century. In the Colonies the wooden clock was
first produced in Connecticut, and the earliest type was associated
with Hartford County. This form was quite common in East
Hartford in 1761, and its first production may have had some
association with Ebenezer Parmele (1690-1777), since an association
between Parmele and all of the earliest makers of wooden clocks
can be traced.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Little is known about Parmele. His father was
a cabinetmaker in Guilford, Connecticut, and Ebenezer practiced
the same craft, in addition to being a boat builder. He was a
man of means, held various town offices, and served as town
treasurer. For a while he operated a cargo sloop on Long Island
Sound. In 1726 he built the first tower clock in Connecticut for
the Guilford meeting house. He was a versatile worker in wood,
and it is believed that he served an apprenticeship in New York
City with a Dutch clockmaker from 1705 to 1710, where he may
have learned to make wooden clocks.</p>

<p>This early type of wooden clock is associated with Benjamin
Cheney (1725-1815), a clockmaker of East Hartford. The early
or "Cheney" type of wooden clock was produced in Connecticut
as late as 1812. A later form of the wooden movement began to
appear about 1790, and was probably introduced by Gideon
Roberts (1749-1813) of Bristol. Roberts had lived in the Wyoming
Valley of Pennsylvania before 1790, and it is conjectured that he
became familiar with the wooden clocks produced by the German
settlers of that region.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that the wooden clock had its colonial origins
in Connecticut, so completely was it adaptable to the pioneer
conditions in that colony. The materials were the abundant
native woods-cherry, apple, oak, and laurel. The parts were
made with simple carpenter tools and a wooden foot lathe, using
the methods of the cabinetmaker. Although it has been suggested
that some relationship may have existed between the
makers of wooden instruments in England, and the makers of
wooden clocks and scientific instruments in the New England
Colonies,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> a careful study has failed to reveal any connection,
and there appears to be little if any parallel between the two
groups. Basically, the use of wood for making some mathematical
instruments in New England resulted from the native
familiarity with this material, which was also employed to a considerable
degree for the construction of domestic and agricultural
implements, and from the fact that many of the early clockmakers
had been trained as or by cabinet makers, carpenters, and even
dish turners. Random examples of a few of the more prominent
clockmakers are Joseph Hopkins, a wood turner; Chauncey
Jerome, who had been apprenticed to a wood turner; and Silas
Hoadley, who had worked with a cabinet maker.</p>

<p>Perhaps a basis for the prevalence of wood in these trades is to
be found in the lines from a familiar poem:</p>

<p>
The Yankee boy, before he's sent to school,<br />
Knows well the mystery of that magic tool,<br />
The Pocket knife.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><br />
</p>

<p>But, from the technical point of view, it should be noted that those
craftsmen who produced clocks and instruments and did not have
their own brass foundries probably found that a good piece of
straight-grained hardwood was as stable for holding its dimensions
with the grain as a piece of brass. Shrinkage was at right
angles to the grain; hence, for fixed linear stability wood was as
good as brass. For rigidity per unit weight, wood was better
than brass; and for availability and ease of working, wood was
superior to brass.</p>

<p>It has often been ventured that wooden clocks were first produced
in Connecticut, because of the scarcity of brass for this
purpose during the years between the beginning of the Revolution
to the end of the War of 1812. The claim is made that brass was
not being produced in the Colonies and that it was imported exclusively
from England during this period. Certainly, the wholesale
price index of metal and metal products shows a steady increase
during this period, and a considerable jump during the
period of the War of 1812, making brass an extremely expensive
material. This may explain why the makers of clocks and instruments
who made and sold brass clocks and instruments were
producing the same products at the same time in wood which,
as we have seen, was both plentiful and a satisfactory substitute.</p>

<p>It can be surmised, therefore, that surveying instruments, as
well as instruments for other purposes, were produced in both brass
and wood simultaneously by many of the New England makers
in order to provide suitable instruments in a flexible price range
to meet the demands of the trade. Whereas today modern manufacturing
methods make it possible to produce instruments in a
wide variety, both in quality and price, to suit the needs and capabilities
of every prospective purchaser, the production facilities of
the 18th century were much more limited. The constant factor of
skilled hand labor was costly. Metal was expensive. As evidenced
in the records of Daniel Burnap, for instance, it was possible
to produce surveying compasses in brass in two grades, presumably
one more elaborate than the other. Yet Burnap's prices
ranged between six pounds and four pounds for the metal instruments,
making them still well out of reach of many of the would-be
surveyors. Accordingly, Burnap&mdash;and presumably numerous
other instrument makers of the period&mdash;produced from wood an
economy model that sold for not more than two pounds, thus
placing the item within the reach of the nonprofessional surveyor.</p>

<p>This theory is supported amply by the discovery that several
of the instrument makers who worked in brass also made instruments
of wood during the same periods. In addition to the evidence
in the records of Daniel Burnap, there are the surviving
surveying instruments in brass and wood made by Samuel Thaxter,
Thomas Greenough, and John Dupee, leaving little if any
doubt that the reason for producing surveying compasses and similar
items of wood during the 18th century was to satisfy the need
for reasonably accurate yet inexpensive instruments.</p>


<p>Surviving Instruments</p>

<p>The fact that the surviving examples of the wooden instruments
were produced only in New England seems to indicate merely
that the New England instrument makers were more familiar with
the use of wood as a material, and had greater facility in working
with it.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly other instruments produced by the 18th-century
American makers have survived in addition to those already found.
Quite likely examples of these wooden instruments still remain hidden
in unexplored attics and other repositories. Yet, if the few
thus far discovered is any criterion, the number ultimately recoverable
will probably be but a fraction of the great number produced
by the 18th-century makers during the half century or more
in which they worked. Even allowing for those probably destroyed
in the natural course of events, one cannot help but wonder what
has happened to the remainder.</p>

<p>A list of the surviving wooden instruments is given in the Appendix
(p. 153). Many of these wooden instruments bear signatures
or other marks that permit identification of their makers, but a
number of specimens have been found that are not signed. In
most instances they show evidence of professional workmanship,
and they may have been the work of known craftsmen. One or
two examples are obviously homemade by unskilled amateur
practitioners.</p>

<p>Several unsigned wooden instruments of professional quality are
in the collection of the Dartmouth College Museum. Of particular
interest is a semicircumferentor (fig. 32) that belonged to the
Reverend Eleazar Wheelock (1711-1779) who founded Moor's
Indian Charity School at Lebanon, Connecticut, which subsequently
developed into Dartmouth College. It is claimed that it was
with this instrument that the area of the college was surveyed when
it moved to Hanover, N.H. The instrument is actually a graphometer
consisting of a block of hard wood faced with a brass plate
with a trough compass; it is tentatively dated about 1769. The
identity of the maker is unknown, but it may have been the product
of Hagger, who made a similar instrument, illustrated here, or it
may have been produced by any one of the other makers noted.
The type of instrument is an old one. It is described in John
Love's <i>Geodaesia, Or the Art of Surveying and Measuring Land</i>,
published in London in 1688. Abel Flint<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> also commented on this
semicircle as being sometime used, as well as the plane table and
perambulator&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>... but of these instruments very little [use] is made in New England; and they
are not often to be met with. For general practice none will be found more
useful than a common chain and a compass upon Rittenhouse's construction.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another of the unusual wooden surveying instruments in the
collection of the Dartmouth College Museum is a wooden surveying
compass (fig. 33) in which the sighting bars appear relatively close
to the dial. A metal plate, painted green, is stamped with the
degrees marked to 90°. A single N for the north point is stamped
into it, presumably with steel punches. The instrument is relatively
primitive, and is sufficiently different from the other examples
noted to merit mention. There is no maker's name, nor any
clue to the date or place or period of origin.</p>

<p>An unsigned semicircumferentor made of wood is owned by
Mr. Roleigh Lee Stubbs of Charleston, West Virginia. The
instrument measures 3-3/4 in. by 7-1/2 in. by 1 in., and there are sighting
bars 3 in. high on a swinging brass bar pinned at the center of the
base. It has a trough compass, and the gradations around the edge
of the semicircle are marked with tiny brass pins. The date
"1784" is stamped into the wood with the same type of figures as
appear in the degree markings, probably with small steel punches.</p>

<p>A surveying compass of the conventional type, also made of
wood, is in The Farmer's Museum at Cooperstown, New York.
The wood is ash or oak, 12-3/4 in. long and 6-1/2 in. in diameter, with
the sighting bars 5 in. high. The compass card consists of cut-out
printed letters pasted upon a printed compass rose, and the fleur-de-lis
at North is inked-in by hand. This may be a homemade
replacement of the original card. The instrument is believed to
date between 1760-1775.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 34.&mdash;18th-century semicircumferentor. Inscribed brass plate is mounted
on a mahogany block; brass sighting bars are mounted on a swivelling bar.
The trough compass is on a silvered dial. In collection of the writer.]</p>

<p>Of equal interest is a large semicircumferentor made by an
unknown American instrument maker in the second half of the
18th century. The instrument (fig. 34) consists of a plate of
hammered brass attached to a quarter circle block of mahogany,
with a glass covered trough compass within a silvered opening, and
the gradations stamped into the brass. The brass sighting bars
are attached to a swivelling bar that can be fixed in place with a
set screw underneath the block. The instrument, which is in the
collection of the writer, is not signed with a maker's name. Its
workmanship is excellent, and professional.</p>

<p>On the basis of a comparison of these instruments with those
produced by known professional makers, it becomes apparent that
all of them were made professionally. The possibility that some
of these wooden surveying compasses may have been produced by
the farmer or local surveyor for his own use is extremely unlikely.
Homemade instruments such as those described below were unquestionably
the exception instead of the rule.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 35.&mdash;Homemade wooden surveying compass carved from block of maple
entirely with a jackknife; painted in red. In collection of Preston R. Bassett,
Ridgefield, Connecticut.]</p>

<p>An exception to this generalization, and an extremely fine
example of the whittler's art, is a surveying compass (fig. 35) in
the collection of Mr. Preston R. Bassett of Ridgefield, Connecticut.
This is a comparatively small instrument made of maple; the body
was painted red. It is carved entirely by means of a jackknife,
and the sighting bars are also whittled to shape and mortised
permanently into the frame. A lid covering the dial is carved from
soft pine. The compass dial is handdrawn in black ink, and the
North point is painted in the form of a decorative fleur-de-lis in
red and green. A homemade ring of pewter surrounds the compass
rose at needle level. This is graduated in degrees, with every 10°
marked, stamped with steel punches. The ring is set into the base
by means of wooden pegs. The steel needle is nicely cut, and it is
probably the only part purchased by the maker.</p>

<p>This is unquestionably a homemade instrument produced by
a skillful whittler early in the 18th century.</p>


<p>Compass Cards</p>

<p>A fact that becomes apparent in a comparison of the surviving
examples of wooden surveying compasses made in New England
is the similarity of the compass cards used by makers in the seaport
cities (see fig. 36). The compass card in each of these instances
is the type designed for a mariner's compass, bearing a star of 32
rays to mark the 32 points of the heavens. The North point is
designated with an elaborate fleur-de-lis, and the East is emphasized
with scrollwork. These are features which were not designed primarily
for land surveying. Presumably, these makers had a quantity
of engraved or printed compass cards that they used in both marine
and land surveying compasses. This is true in the case of the
compasses made by James and Joseph Halsy, Greenough, Clough,
Warren, Thaxter, Dupee, Breed, and Bowles. On the other hand,
the dial of Huntington's compass was painted directly on the
wood, and the semicircumferentors do not utilize the marine
compass card. Obviously these makers resorted to this practice
for reasons of economy&mdash;to reduce costs of engraving and printing,
and using the same card for both types of instruments that they
produced.</p>


<p>Trade Signs</p>

<p>An interesting sidelight in the study of the makers of scientific
instruments is the advertising they used, particularly the design
of their signboards. The most popular symbol appears to have
been the quadrant, as the phrase "At the Sign of the Quadrant"
is found repeatedly in advertising in several of the seaport cities
of the 18th century.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 36.&mdash;Unsigned wooden surveying compass, with an interesting example
of a mariner's compass card.]</p>

<p>In Providence, William Hamlin used the designation in the
first part of the 19th century, while Philadelphian John Gould
featured the sign at the end of the 18th century. During an even
earlier period, William Hinton designated his address to be "At
Hadley's Quadrant" in New York City. Both Gould and Hinton
were English, which may have had some bearing on their selection
of the quadrant as a symbol of their merchandise.</p>

<p>Other signboards were as colorful, such as Jonathan Dakin's
"Sign of the Hand and Beam," James Youle's "Sign of the Cross-Knives
and Gun," and Charles Kugler's house in Philadelphia
with its "Sign of the Seven Stars" (that is, Great Bear), which
housed the shops of several instrument makers.</p>

<p>The two most interesting and significant of the instrument
makers' trade signs were those advertising the shop of Samuel
Thaxter. The first of these was the carved wooden figure of
"The Little Admiral," which was a favorite landmark at No. 1
Long Wharf in Boston for almost a century and a half. It was
the handiwork of John Skillin, the 18th-century woodcarver of
Boston, upon whose death on January 24, 1800, the <i>Chronicle</i>
commented that "he was for many years the most eminent of his
profession." John Skillin and his brother Simeon worked in
Boston from about 1777 and produced most of the figureheads
that issued from that port during that period, as well as a number
of other notable ornamental wooden figures.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 37.&mdash;"The Little Admiral," trade sign used for almost a century and a
half in Boston, first by William Williams and later by Samuel Thaxter. Reputed
to have been carved by John Skillin of Boston. In collection of the
Bostonian Society.]</p>

<p>According to Mrs. H. Ropes Cabot of the Bostonian Society,
the figure of "The Little Admiral" (fig. 37) had been carved for
William Williams, who brought it with him to Boston from
Marblehead in 1770 when he established his shop. The figure
was installed in front of the Crown Coffee House, and Williams's
shop was thereafter designated by this symbol. The trade sign
survived through the years of the Revolutionary War. When
the original building of the Coffee House was burned, the carving
was saved and installed on the new building erected in its place.
In an account of Boston landmarks, Porter<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> related the figure
to the Admiral Vernon Tavern at the eastern corner of Merchants
Row. He was proved to have been in error, however, since the
trade sign of that public-house was a portrait bust of Admiral
Vernon and the place was known as the Vernon Head Tavern for
half a century, even after the end of the Revolution.</p>

<p>When Samuel Thaxter purchased the business from Williams's
estate he acquired the figure as well, and he moved it to each new
location for his shop. The figure of "The Little Admiral" continued
to designate the firm even after Thaxter's death, until the
firm finally went out of existence at the beginning of the 20th
century. When the old store was torn down in 1901, the figure was
preserved, presumably by the last owner's family. In 1916 it was
acquired for the Bostonian Society by several of its members, and
the figure has been preserved in the Society's Council Chamber
since that time.</p>

<p>The other interesting trade sign utilized by Samuel Thaxter is
a carved figure of Father Time that is credited to John Skillin
(see fig. 38). The figure is believed to have been commissioned
by Thaxter during the last decade of the 18th century and installed
by him in the interior of his shop. It is an important example
of the American woodcarver's art, and is equivalent to the best
work of the Skillin brothers.</p>

<p>The Makers</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the names of the craftsmen who produced wooden
instruments are not noted among the instrument makers. With
only one or two exceptions, their names are hitherto unknown in
the history of American science, and for that reason it has been
considered advisable to present all available information that could
be accumulated about them.</p>


<p><i>Joseph Halsy</i></p>

<p>The earliest known maker of wooden scientific instruments of
Boston was Joseph Halsy. He appears to have been one of the
sons of the James Halsie I, who was mentioned in a land deed of
1674 as a mathematician.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The land records indicate that James I
was the father of several children, including Rebecca, a spinster;
John Halsey, a mariner who died before 1716; Sarah, who later
became Mrs. Dorsan; another daughter, name unknown, who
became the wife of a Joseph Gilbert and the mother of two daughters
and a son who inherited her share of her father's estate;
Nathaniel Halsie; and probably Joseph Halsy. James Halsie I
appears to have owned property consisting of land, a wooden house,
and wharves on the North End, on North Street between Sun
Court and Fleet Street.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The date of birth of Joseph Halsy of Boston has not been found,
but mention is made of the fact that on January 29, 1697, he was
married to Elizabeth Eldridge, the daughter of a mariner named
Joseph Eldridge, and that five children resulted from the marriage,
three sons and two daughters.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> One son, Joseph, died in infancy
and a daughter, Elizabeth, died at an early age.</p>

<p>On February 26, 1704/5 Halsy purchased from Rebecca Halsey,
the spinster daughter of James, her share in the house and land
of her late father on North Street between Sun Court and Fleet
Street.</p>

<p>On April 19, 1714, Halsy and his wife deeded a house and land
on North End, at the corner of Hanover and Salutation Streets,
to a shipwright named Joseph Hood. Two years later, on March 2,
1716, he purchased from Jane, his sister-in-law, who was the widow
of the mariner John Halsy, her share of the house and land of
James Halsie, being the same property on North Street. On
March 27 of the same year he purchased the share in the same
property belonging to Sarah Dorsan, his widowed sister. In
August 1719 he was forced to mortgage some of the property to
a merchant named John Frizell, but the mortgage was cancelled
in 1741.</p>

<p>Halsy was married for a second time on January 10, 1731, to
Mrs. Anna Lloyd, a widow.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 39.&mdash;Wooden surveying compass "Made and sold by Joseph Halsy, Boston,
New England." The instrument, made of maple, is 11 in. long and has a diameter
of 5-3/4 in. In the collection of New Hampshire Historical Society, Concord.]</p>

<p>During the 1730's, Halsy continued to buy out the heirs of
James Halsie. On March 6, 1730, he acquired the share of Mary
Gilbert, a granddaughter, and on the same date he purchased from
the James Halsey heirs their inheritance "part to land, wharf,
house, shop and buildings on North Street." Other heirs remained,
for in June 9, 1732, he bought out the share of Marty Partridge,
another granddaughter, and on June 27 the share of Joseph Gilbert,
Jr., a grandson. In October 1740 he was forced to mortgage as
security to James Bowdoin a house and land on the southwest
side of North Street, but this was cancelled when on August 26,
1751, Joseph Halsey and his wife, Anna, deeded to James Noble
the land, wooden house, and wharves near Fish Street on North
Street between Sun Court and Fleet Street, which apparently was
formerly the property of James Halsey that Joseph had acquired
with so much trouble over a period of 40 years.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The following advertisement relating to instruments sold by
Halsy appeared in the issues of <i>The Boston Gazette</i> for the months
of September and October 1738:</p>

<blockquote><p>Made and sold by Joseph Halsey jun. Hadley's New Invented Quadrant or
Octant the best and exacted Instrument for taking the Latitude or Other
Altitudes at Sea, as ever yet Invented.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The last dated record relating to Joseph Halsy which has been
found is a letter dated February 3, 1762, that he wrote to Robert
Treat Paine concerning legal matters.</p>

<p>Only one complete instrument produced by Joseph Halsy appears
to have survived&mdash;an especially fine wooden surveyors compass
(fig. 39) in the collection of the New Hampshire Historical Society.
It is made of maple. The compass card, probably the most interesting
of any found in the wooden instruments, is hand-colored in
black, blue, red, and gold. A fleur-de-lis marks the North point,
and triangular pointers indicate the other compass directions.
Inside the pointers are crudely painted female figures representing
the seven arts: NW, Grammar; W, Logick; SW, Geometry; S,
Arithmetick; SE, Astronomy; E, Rhetorick; and NE, Musick.
Within a medallion at the center of the compass card is depicted
a sailing vessel at sea; surrounding the medallion is a riband
inscribed "Made and Sold by <span class="smcap">Joseph Halsy</span> Boston&mdash;New
England."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Another, but much less elaborate, compass card used by Joseph
Halsy, is an engraved example (fig. 40) found glued in Thomas
Paine's own manuscript copy of Charles Morton's <i>Compendium
Physicae</i>, which is preserved in the collection of the Massachusetts
Historical Society.</p>

<p>John Halsy (fl. 1700-1750), also a mathematical instrument
maker, had a shop on Green Street, in Boston, according to the
Record Commissioner's "Report of the City of Boston." He was
married on December 10, 1700, by the Reverend Cotton Mather.
He probably was a brother of Joseph Halsy who worked in the
same period.</p>

<p>John Halsy subsequently abandoned his instrument-making
business to become a pirate. He went out to Madagascar, where
it is reported that he died in his own bed. He was buried with
the rites of the Church of England in his own watermelon patch.</p>

<p><i>James Halsy II</i></p>

<p>James Halsy II (1695-1767), a mathematical instrument maker,
was born in Boston on April 10, 1695, the son of Nathaniel and
Hannah (Gross) Halsie. The parents had been married by the
Reverend Cotton Mather in June 1693.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In 1716 young James
Halsy was a member of the Artillery Company, and by 1720 he
had the rating of 4th sergeant. He held town offices and was one
of the founders of the New Brick Church of Boston. On May 30,
1717, he married Anna Gutridge (Goodrich). Ten years later, on
September 22, 1727, he bought a house and land on North Bennett
and Tileston Streets from Hugh Hall, a merchant; at the same time
he deeded to Hall some land and a house adjacent to the latter
on the southwest side of Green Street. On January 5, 1837, he
deeded to his aunt(?), a single woman named Huldah Gross, a
house and land on Ann Street that he had inherited from Thomas
Gross, his grandfather. Several more real estate negotiations were
recorded in the course of the next few years. In October 1740 he
purchased a house and land on the north side of North Bennet
Street from John Endicott; in January 1741 land on the east side
of North Bennett Street; and in November 1748 half of the house
and land of Edward Pell, adjacent to Huldah Gross, on Cross
Street; finally, in October 1753, he purchased land on Tileston and
North Bennett Streets from John Grant.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Halsy died on January 2, 1767, at the age of 72. In his will
dated May 1, 1766, and probated January 2, 1767, by which his
wife Anna was the executrix of his estate, he left her the income
of his real and personal estate. He apparently was survived by
three daughters and a son, also named James Halsy. He divided
his real estate in Boston amongst his daughters, and to his son he
left land in New Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The only known surviving instrument bearing James Halsy's
name is a wooden surveying compass (fig. 41) in the collection
of the Peabody Museum in Salem. The engraved compass card
is quite similar to the one used by Thomas Greenough. In the
central medallion is an elaborate royal crown, and in the circle
around the medallion is inscribed "Made and Sold by <span class="smcap">James
Halsy</span> near Ye Draw Bridge in Boston."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><i>Thomas Greenough</i></p>

<p>Contemporary with James Halsy II was Thomas Greenough
(1710-1785), who was born in Boston in 1710, the son of John and
Elizabeth (Gross) Greenough. His father was a shipwright in
the North End of Boston, and one of Thomas's brothers, Newman
Greenough, became a sailmaker. Thomas also had a sister named
Jerusha, who later figured in his real estate negotiations.</p>

<p>The earliest known record relating to Greenough is of his marriage
in 1734 to Martha Clarke, daughter of William and Sarah
Clarke of Boston. Nine children resulted from this marriage over
the course of the next 16 years; four of these were sons. On
January 27 of the year of his marriage he purchased a house on the
northwest side of North Street, between Mill Creek and Union
Street, from John White and Nathaniel Roberts. On August 1,
1736, Greenough purchased the house and land of his father-in-law,
William Clarke, on the south side of Portland Street. On
October 28 he mortgaged to his mother his house on Ann Street
(which appears to have been the house he had purchased on
North Street), and at the same time he deeded to his brother
Newman all his right and title in his father's estate at the North
End. Greenough was only 24 at the time of his marriage, and he
apparently became involved in real estate, by choice or by necessity,
to a considerable degree.</p>

<p>Greenough, in 1744, was a member of a militia company in
Boston,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and three years later, in 1747, he was listed as third
sergeant. He was a firm patriot, held a town office, and was a
founder and deacon of the New Brick Church in Boston.</p>

<p>Greenough had a substantial interest in the holdings of his late
father-in-law. For example, on August 11, 1744, he and his wife
deeded to a merchant named James Pitts the seawall, or new wharf,
"before the Town of Boston in the front and rear lying to the northward
of King Street Pier, North Wharf and flats of James Bowdoin,"
all of which was part of the estate of his deceased father-in-law
that apparently had been inherited by his wife. In the
following year, on November 1, 1745, he purchased a house and
land on Portland Street from his widowed mother-in-law and then
on March 31, 1746, he and his wife deeded the same house and land
to a merchant named Stephen Hall. Numerous other negotiations
of the same nature are on record.</p>

<p>At some time between 1748 and 1750 Greenough's first wife,
Martha, died, and in 1750 he married Sarah Stoddard. Three
more children, all sons, resulted from this second marriage. His
real estate negotiations continued full pace during the second
marriage as during the first.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Greenough's second wife preceded him in death, and Greenough
died in 1785 at the age of 75. His will, probated on August 23,
1785, had been made on May 21, 1782;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> it contained some interesting
bequests:</p>

<blockquote><p>Executors: my two sons, David S. and William Greenough. Legatees:
to the children of my son Thomas, deceased, Rachel, Ann, and Sally Greenough,
£13.6.8 each. To their sister Betty £5. To the children of my son
John deceased, 200 acres of land. I also give his eldest son John my silver can,
fellow to the one I gave his father. To his sons Wm. and David, and to his
daughters, Sarah, Abigail, and Mehitible £5 each and the house they live
in. My daughter, Sarah Edwards, £10 and a silver chafing dish. My
daughter Martha Stone all my lands in the County of York, Cape Porpoise,
and Wells, and my silver salver, and her son Thomas £5 and a silver porringer.
My daughter Elizabeth Brooks £10 and a silver tea pot. My
daughter Mary Savage £40 and to her son Thomas one silver porringer.
To the children of my daughter Jerusha, deceased, Martha Clark Lepear and
Sally Lepear each of them, £50, and a pair of salt shovels, and a pepper box,
silver. All the rest of my estate to my two sons, David Stoddard Greenough,
and Wm. Greenough. The late Shute Shrimpton Yeoman, Esq., left an
estate to my late spouse Sarah, and to her children, in the Island of Antigua.
In case my son David should have a legal possession of same, and Wm. no
part, in that case I give my son David £100 and sundry pieces as per schedule
amount to £63.11.3. All the rest of my estate to my son, William Greenough.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of particular interest with relation to Greenough's business in
instruments is the following advertisement that appeared on
May 11, 1742, in <i>The Boston Gazette</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To be sold by Capt. Cyprian Southack at his House near the Orange Tree
and at Mr. Tho. Greenough's Mathematical Instrument Maker near the
Draw Bridge, said Southack's Char[t]s of the Coast from Sandy Point of
New York to Canso.</p></blockquote>

<p>Invaluable for this study are Thomas Greenough's manuscript
accounts that have survived in the collections of the Massachusetts
Historical Society. The following itemized entries are selected
from Greenough's business accounts over a period of two decades
to provide data on the prices current in the second half of the 18th
century for new instruments and for repairing others:</p>

</p>

<p>Other documents in the same collection indicate that Greenough's
business interests were substantial and not limited merely to the
construction of instruments. On July 31, 1769, Greenough's name
appeared on the Boston Citizens' Non-Importation Agreement.
Subsequently, on December 14, 1774, there is Greenough's signed
receipt, with the amount left blank, stating that he had "REC'D.
of Capt. Thomas Godfrey the Sum of &mdash;&mdash; in full for my Negro
man Cuffes Shair in the Whaling Voige &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Greenough apparently was succeeded in business by his son
William Greenough. Mr. Lawrence B. Romaine of Middleboro,
Massachusetts, in 1939 described a wooden surveying compass
with its own hand-whittled tripod made of oak which bore a
compass card inscribed "Made by William Greenough, Boston,
N.E."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The compass was protected by a pine cover that fitted
closely between the sights. The present location of this instrument
is not known, but it appears to be the only known example by
William Greenough made of wood.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In the Greenough family at the present time is a brass surveying
compass (fig. 42) of fine quality and of the period before or during
the American Revolution. The dial is finely engraved with a
Tudor rose at its center, and around it is the inscription "<span class="smcap">Thomas
Greenough Boston</span> Fecit." The compass face is mounted
to the main blade with two copper rivets. The holding screws
for the vane and tripod mounting are rather crudely hand cut
with wing-nut ends.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

National Museum by Laurits C. Eichner of Clifton, New Jersey. USNM

<p>Five other surveying compasses made by Thomas Greenough
are known, and all are made of wood: the one in the Franklin
Institute is made of gum (fig. 43), one in Old Sturbridge is made of
maple, one in the Bucks County Historical collection at the Mercer
Museum is made of cherry, one owned by this writer is made of
basswood, and one on loan to the U.S. National Museum from
Mr. Laurits C. Eichner is made of hickory (fig. 44).</p>

<p>The compass at the Mercer Museum forms part of the surveyor's
gear used to lay out the town of Weymouth, Massachusetts. The
example in hickory on loan to the U.S. National Museum, as is
usually the case with the compass cards of the Thomas Greenough
instruments, has the central ring printed in gilt, and the inscription
has turned black, making the inscription almost illegible. This
specimen was owned by Joseph Frye, who was given a land grant in
what is now Fryeburg, Maine, in 1762. He allegedly used this
compass for surveying that land. In 1783 he assembled a manuscript
book of tables (see fig. 45) for use in surveying for his son
Joseph Frye, Jr. This manuscript also is part of the loan to the
U.S. National Museum.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The compass card in each of these five instruments is identical,
designed for use in the mariner's compass (see fig. 46). A gentleman
in the dress of about 1740 stands on the shore using a Davis
quadrant. Offshore in the harbor is a schooner of the 1750 period.
Minor features of the scene are touched up in red, presumably
printed, since they are consistent in all of the cards.</p>


<p><i>William Williams</i></p>

<p>Although not one of the earliest instrument makers in Boston,
but certainly one of the more significant, was William Williams
(1737/8-1792). He was the son of Capt. John Williams, a shopkeeper
who died on March 22, 1748, at the age of 41, and who was
buried in King's Chapel Burial Ground.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>William Williams was born in 1737 or 1738. He was ten years
of age when his father died, and he had two brothers and two
sisters. His father left a substantial estate of £6,575, of which
£4,544/9/4 was for the inventory of the shop merchandise. One of
the appraisers for his estate, Jotham Maverick, married the
widowed Mrs. Williams less than a year later, on January 20,
1748/9.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In 1770 William Williams established himself as a mathematical
instrument maker and clockmaker at No. 1 Long Wharf, at the
Crown Coffee House, as it was then known. The shop was located
on the corner of State and Chatham Streets, on premises owned
by Robert Shillcock.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 47.&mdash;Quadrant, showing signature of Thomas Greenough. Photo courtesy
Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford.]</p>

<p>Williams may have worked as an instrument maker in Marblehead
before returning to his native Boston. According to Felt,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
an instrument maker named William Williams at Marblehead
advertised in the Salem newspapers in the early 1770's. However,
in 1768 Williams was producing instruments from an address in
King Street, Boston. (See figure 48.) An advertisement inserted
by Williams appeared in the March 12, 1770, issue of <i>The Boston
Gazette</i>. It was this same issue that reported the Boston Massacre.
One of the victims was Williams' step-brother Samuel Maverick,
the son of his stepfather Jotham Maverick by a first marriage.</p>

<p>In 1773 Williams married Joyce Shillcock, the daughter of
his landlord. During the Revolutionary War, Williams saw
active service as a private in Captain Mills' company, of Col.
Jeduthan Baldwin's regiment of artificers, during the years 1777-1779.
In 1780 he served in Captain Pattin's company of General
Knox's artillery, which was stationed at West Point.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>With the conclusion of the war Williams returned to the craft of
instrument-making in his shop, at No. 1 Long Wharf. In 1782
his wife, Joyce, inherited the property from her mother, the
widow Hannah Shillcock, following the latter's death in that
year. In the following May it is recorded that Williams purchased
the warehouse and land on the north side of State Street from
Benjamin Brown, a trader. By a separate deed, he and his wife
released to Brown the warehouse and land which had been the
property of his father-in-law in exchange for a clear title to one-half
share of the store and land under it "which is next to the
street called King Street." On February 7, 1784, he bought a
share of the lower division at Long Wharf, No. 7, from Arnold
Welles. On May 17 of the same year he succeeded in buying out
Brown's half share of the lower division of Long Wharf at Nos.
1 and 7, and at the same time he deeded to Brown one-half
share of No. 7 Long Wharf, together with all its dockage and
wharfage. Finally, on January 20, 1785, Williams and his wife
deeded to Brown all rights to land of No. 7 Long Wharf, reserving
for himself his rights in the flats, wharfage, and dockage.</p>

<p>On March 23, 1787, Williams deeded to Joseph Helyer, a
blockmaker, the store and land under same, and half the wharfage
properly belonging to Lot No. 1. On October 20 of the same
year he sold to Brown a part or share of No. 7 Long Wharf, and
on March 24, 1788, he purchased land with a wooden store at
State Street and Long Wharf from Benjamin Brown. On June
26 he bought the land and store of Joseph Helyer on the north
side of Long Wharf.</p>

<p>Williams engaged in only two more transactions before his
death. On March 28, 1790, he mortgaged to Joseph Greene, a
merchant, the land with wooden store at the head of Long Wharf
on the northeast side of State Street; this mortgage was cancelled
on May 29, 1793. On October 1, 1791, he deeded to Benjamin
Brown a one-half share or 1/48th of all the dockage and wharfage
of Long Wharf that appertained to one-half of Lot No. 1, which
he had previously purchased from Welles as noted, as well as
1/48th of the proprietor's purchase of Gordon's lands and buildings
adjoining the Wharf.</p>

<p>Williams died on January 15, 1792, at age 44. The administrator
of his estate was a merchant named Abraham Quincy. By order
of the Supreme Court, in order to settle his estate, Williams'
store building at No. 1 Long Wharf was ordered sold at public
auction. Although on the site of the Crown Coffee House, it
was a new building erected in 1780 after the Coffee House had
burned. The purchaser appears to have been John Osborn, a
merchant, because on May 10, 1793, Quincy, Williams' administrator,
deeded to Osborn the land with wooden store at Long
Wharf on State Street.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The only instrument made by Williams which appears to have
survived is a Davis backstaff (fig. 49) marked "By Wm. Williams,
King Street, Boston, for Malachi Allen, 1768"; this instrument is
now in the collection of the Peabody Museum in Salem, Massachusetts.
It is to be noted from this inscription that this instrument
was an early example of Williams' work, produced at the age of
20, prior to the opening of his shop at the Crown Coffee House.</p>

<p>In 1770, when Williams opened his shop, the carved sign of
"The Little Admiral" (fig. 37) was installed in front of the Crown
Coffee House, and Williams' establishment was thereafter designated
by this symbol.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In his shop at No. 1 Long Wharf, Williams exercised his crafts
of instrument-and clockmaking, and he made and sold a large
assortment of instruments, as well as time glasses which measured
from one quarter minute to two hours.</p>

Williams in King Street Boston" for "Malachi Allen 1768." In collection of

<p>The name of Williams appears also in the Day Books of Paul
Revere. Under date of April 16, 1792, there is the following entry:</p>

<p>
Mr. William Williams Dr<br />
To Engravg plate for hatt bills 0-18-0<br />
To 2 hund prints 0-6-0.<br />
</p>

<p>From June 24, 1792, to January 28, 1797, Revere entered 12
charges against Williams for 8,500 hat bills for the total amount
of £14/15/0.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>


<p><i>Samuel Thaxter</i></p>

<p>Closely associated with the name of William Williams is that
of another instrument maker of Boston, Samuel Thaxter (1769-1842).
Thaxter was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, on December
13, 1769, the son of Samuel and Bathsheba (Lincoln)
Thaxter. His father, who had been born in Hingham in 1744,
was married on December 27, 1768, and he became the father of six
children, of whom Samuel was the eldest. Samuel Thaxter, Sr.,
was apparently a man of means, for he is listed as a "Gentleman"
and a loyal subject of King George. He resided on North Street in
Hingham, near Ship Street. He died on the island of Campobello
at the age of 44 years on May 27, 1788.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Samuel Thaxter, as well as several generations of his family
before him, was born in the old Thomas Thaxter mansion that was
built by the settler of that name in 1652. During the Revolution
Samuel's father, Maj. Samuel Thaxter, concealed Tories from the
Committee of Safety in a blind passage with a secret door in the old
house. From there he smuggled them to Boston. At the massacre
of Fort William, Major Thaxter was one of those captured by the
Indians. While tied to a tree, he saw two French officers, and
demanded whether this was the treatment they gave to commissioned
officers. They allowed him to go free and he dragged himself
to Fort Edward. Meanwhile, his comrades had reported him
missing in action, and Dr. Gay preached his funeral sermon in
Hingham shortly before Thaxter's return. The old Thaxter
mansion was torn down in 1864.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Young Samuel Thaxter moved from Hingham to Boston, where
he is first heard of in 1792. On June 14, 1792, Thaxter married
Polly Helyer, the niece of William Williams.</p>

<p>Within a month after the sale of Williams' property at public
auction, Thaxter acquired the instrument-making business. Apparently
the new owner of the premises required the business
to move, and Thaxter established himself at No. 9 Butler's Row.
A month after the Williams auction Thaxter announced his new
location in an advertisement (fig. 50) in <i>The Columbia Centinel</i> of
May 22, 1793.</p>

<p>Thaxter's new location was a wooden store structure, on the
north side of Butler's Row that was owned by Andrew Hall and
Eunice Fitch in 1798. It was in the rear of the north side of State
Street, running from Merchants Row to the water.</p>

<p>By 1796 Thaxter had moved from this location to No. 49 State
Street, on the north side opposite to Broad Street, a brick store
owned by Joseph Lovering &amp; Sons, tallow chandlers. He continued
to do business at this address until 1815, when he moved to
27 State Street, on the opposite side of the street. The new location
was in a brick dwelling, opposite Merchants Row, that was
owned by Joseph Clough, a housewright.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 50.&mdash;Advertisement of Samuel Thaxter in <i>The Columbia Centinel</i>, May 22,
1793. Photo courtesy Harvard University Library.]</p>

<p>In about 1825 Thaxter moved his business once more, to 125
State Street, the east corner of Broad Street. This building was
occupied by Charles Stimpson, Jr., a stationer who was one of the
publishers of the <i>Boston Annual Advertiser</i>, which was annexed to
the Boston Directory of 1826. The building was owned by
Jonathan Phillips, the first mayor of Boston. In the cellar of the
building was a victualler named Augustus Adams.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The dominating feature of Thaxter's shop from the time it was
opened was the carved figure of "The Little Admiral," the trade
sign first used by Williams.</p>

<p>The firm of Samuel Thaxter eventually became Samuel Thaxter
&amp; Son, and it continued with that name until past the middle of the
19th century. Samuel Thaxter died in April 1842 at the age of
72 years. The entry for the firm in the 1843 City Directory listed
S. T. Cushing as the new owner. From the initials, it seems likely that his full name was Samuel Thaxter Cushing, and that he was
the grandson of the original Samuel Thaxter. S. T. Cushing continued
to be listed as the owner of the firm until 1899, when he was
succeeded by A. T. Cushing, presumably a son of the former.
The old store was finally demolished in 1901.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Comparison of a
photograph of the building just before its demolition with a copy of
Thaxter's trade card (fig. 51) of the mid-19th century shows that
the building underwent little change in the period. The "Little
Admiral" is barely visible in both views.</p>

<p>In 1796, shortly after his marriage, Thaxter made his home on</p>

<p>Fish Street (now North Street), but in 1800 he was living at 54
Middle Street (Hanover Street). By 1807 he had moved to a new
home on Fleet Street. His last home address, at the time of his
death, was 41 Pinckney Street.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>In the collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society there
is a receipted bill (fig. 55) from Samuel Thaxter dated July 1, 1801,
to Sam Brown, for touching up and repairing nine compasses for
the French corvelle <i>Berceau</i>.</p>

<p><i>John Dupee</i></p>

<p>John Dupee of Boston apparently was another instrument maker
of the pre-Revolutionary period actively engaged in producing
wooden surveying compasses. Three wooden instruments with
his compass card exist in private and public collections. The
instruments are quite similar: the wood in each case is walnut or
applewood, with an engraved paper mariner's compass card; a
schooner at sea is figured within the central medallion, and inscribed
within the riband enclosing it are the words "Made and
Sold by <span class="smcap">John Dupee</span> Ye North Side of Swing Bridge Boston New
Eng." One of the instruments is owned by the South Natick
[Massachusetts] Historical Society; a second example is in the
collection of the Bostonian Society; and a third is owned by a
private collector.</p>

<p>There is no record of a maker of scientific instruments or clocks
by the name of Dupee, although the name John Dupee occurs in
the city records of Boston during the early decades of the 18th
century. An advertisement in the February 9, 1761, issue of
<i>The Boston Gazette</i> states that</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Isaac Dupee</span>, Carver, Advertises his Customers and others, that since the
late Fire (on Dock Square) he has opened a shop the North side of the Swing-Bridge,
opposite to <i>Thomas Tyler's</i>, Esq.; where Business will be carried on
as usual with Fidelity and Dispatch.</p></blockquote>

<p>The natural assumption would be that the three instruments
were produced in Isaac Dupee's shop after 1761, perhaps by the
carver's son. The use of an engraved compass card indicates that
the instruments were not unique, and that a number of others were
produced or contemplated. On the other hand, it is likely that
the maker produced other types of instruments utilizing such a
card, such as mariner's compasses.</p>


<p><i>Jere Clough</i></p>

<p>Another instrument maker, presumably of Boston, is Jere Clough.
The only instrument bearing his name known at present is a surveying
compass (fig. 56), made of wood, in the Streeter Collection
of Weights and Measures at Yale University. Clough's name does
not appear on any of the lists of instrument makers or clockmakers,
yet it is a name that is fairly prevalent in Boston. In 1741, for
instance, one Joseph Clough of Boston was a maker of bellows.
He produced bellows of all types&mdash;for furnaces, refiners, blacksmiths,
braziers, and goldsmiths.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 56.&mdash;Wooden instrument made by Jere Clough. In Streeter Collection of

<p>[Illustration: Figure 57.&mdash;Wooden surveying compass made by Andrew Newell (1749-1798) of
Boston. It is made of mahogany, is 11-1/2 in. long, and has a diameter of 5 in.
The engraved compass card is signed by Nathaniel Hurd, goldsmith, silversmith,
and engraver of Boston. In collection of Yale University Art Gallery.]</p>


<p><i>Andrew Newell</i></p>

<p>An instrument of considerable significance is another wooden
surveyor's compass, in the collection of the Yale University Art
Gallery. This compass (fig. 57) is made of rich brown San Domingo
mahogany with sighting bars of boxwood. A mariner's card,
set into the opening with a metal vernier scale, is in the usual form
of the mariner's compass card of the 18th century; it is executed
as a line engraving. A ship and the Boston harbor lighthouse are
featured in the central medallion. On a riband encircling the
medallion is the inscription "Made by <span class="smcap">ANDW. NEWELL</span> East End
of the <span class="smcap">MARKET BOSTON</span>," Engraved in script at the southern
tip of the star is the signature "N. Hurd Sct."</p>

<p>Relatively little is known about Andrew Newell (1749-1798)
except that he was a maker of mathematical instruments. An
entry in the first Boston directory, in 1789, listed "Andrew Newell,
instrument maker, 61 State Street." The directory of 1796 mentioned
Newell as having a shop on the "East side of the Market,"
the address that appears on the surveying compass.</p>

<p>Two years later the Boston directory listed Andrew Newell and
Son, and in 1800 the listing included only the name of Joseph
Newell, who may have been the son. Another mathematical
instrument maker named Charles Newell may have been another
son of Andrew Newell; his name does not appear in the city
Directory until in the 19th century. An instrument with the
signature "Newell &amp; Son, Makers, East End of Faneuil Hall,
Boston" is in the collection of the Bostonian Society.</p>

<p>An important feature of the Newell instrument is the fact
that the engraver of the compass card was Nathaniel Hurd (1729-1777),
the peer of goldsmiths and engravers of the colonial period.
This compass card is a previously unrecorded example of Hurd's
work, and constitutes a work of art, making the compass a historic
scientific instrument.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The compass was presented to the Yale
University Art Gallery by a Yale alumnus, Mr. Henry G. Schiff
of New York City. No other examples have thus far been found.</p>


<p><i>Aaron Breed</i></p>

<p>Aaron Breed (1791-1861) is a relatively unknown maker of
mathematical instruments who worked in Boston into the 19th
century. He specialized in nautical, mathematical and optical
instruments, with an address at 173 Broad Street, and another
at No. 2 Rowe's Wharf, "At the Sign of the Quadrant." Breed
made surveying instruments in brass and in wood. A brass instrument
is in the Henry Ford Museum, and a wooden instrument is in
the collection of Old Sturbridge Village. The latter is fashioned
from walnut with an engraved compass card inscribed "Aaron
Breed Boston."</p>


<p><i>Charles Thacher</i></p>

<p>The name of Charles Thacher appears on the compass card of a
wooden surveying compass (fig. 58) in the collection of the Mariners'
Museum, Norfolk, Virginia. No record of this maker has been
found, but the engraved compass card indicates that he probably
worked in New England.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 58.&mdash;Wooden surveying compass made by Charles Thacher. It is made

<p><i>Benjamin King Hagger</i></p>

<p>Benjamin King Hagger (c. 1769-1834) was the scion of two well-known
families of instrument makers in New England, so it is not
surprising that he worked in the same craft.</p>

<p>It is believed that Hagger was born in Newport, Rhode Island,
about 1769, the son of William Guyse Hagger and of a sister of
Benjamin King. Although his father made instruments&mdash;at first
in partnership with Benjamin King, and then working alone&mdash;in
Newport at least as late as 1776, the family appears to have moved
after the Revolution. William Guyse Hagger's name did not
appear in the 1790 census of Newport, and it is presumed that he
moved with his family to Boston.</p>

<p>Benjamin King Hagger was listed in the first city directory of
Boston in 1789 as "a mathematical instrument maker" with an
address on Ann Street; he was only 20 years of age at this time.</p>

<p>On November 10, 1793, Benjamin King Hagger, "mathematical
instrument maker," purchased land with buildings on Prince Street
near Snow Hill Street from one Peter Greene. Two years later,
on December 1, 1795, Hagger, now listed simply as a "merchant,"
purchased a brick house, a wooden house, and a shed with land
from William Ballard, a tailor of Framingham and an heir of
Samuel Ballard. The property was located on the east side of
North Street, south of Mill Creek. At the time of purchase,
Hagger mortgaged the property to Ballard, and also mortgaged to
him the house and land previously purchased from Greene.</p>

<p>Hagger was listed as a ship chandler in the following year when
on March 24, 1796, he deeded part of his land on Prince Street
to William and George Hillman, minors.</p>

<p>On June 22, 1796, three months later, Hagger, now listed as
"mathematical instrument maker, and ship-chandler" deeded to a
mariner named Thomas Wallis a house and land that formed part
of his original purchase near Copp's Hill from Peter Greene. Then
on July 21, 1796, he purchased from William Ballard all his right
to the brick house and land on North Street (Ann Street), at the
same time mortgaging the property to William Ballard, Jr., of
Framingham. This mortgage was cancelled on April 11, 1798.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>These negotiations took place before marriage. A report of the
Record Commissioners of Boston, states that "William King
Hagger of Boston and Mehitable Ballard of Framingham were
married October 6, 1796." The entry appears to be in error because
the marriage intentions had read "Benjamin King Hagger." It is
presumed that Mehitable was the daughter of William Ballard,
the tailor of Framingham, from whom Hagger had bought his
house on Ann Street, south of Mill Creek.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Benjamin King Hagger is listed in the city directory of Boston
for 1798 as a "mathematical instrument maker" on Ann Street.
This, however, is the last listing for his name in Boston, as his
name does not appear in the 1803 or subsequent directories.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1798 Hagger appears to have left Boston together
with his wife, and it is probable that he established himself as an
instrument maker in another Massachusetts community, at present
unknown. In about 1816 Hagger moved with his family to Baltimore
and continued his instrument-making business.</p>

<p>The records of the 1850 Federal census of Baltimore indicate
that two of Hagger's sons, John W. and William G. Hagger, had
been born in 1800 and 1806 respectively, in Massachusetts, presumably
in the community to which Hagger had moved from
Boston before moving once more to Baltimore.</p>

<p>According to Matchett's Baltimore directory for 1824, Hagger
was a "mathematical and optical instrument maker" with a shop
at 57 South Street. His advertisement in the directory stated
that he</p>

<blockquote><p>Respectfully acquaints his fellow citizens that he executes all orders in the
line of his business with punctuality and confidently professes to give satisfaction
to his employers, from the experience of a regular apprenticeship and
37 years practice.</p></blockquote>

<p>This indicates that Hagger completed his apprenticeship in 1787,
when he was 18, and since then had been established in his own business
or had worked for another as a journeyman instrument maker.
His first advertisement in the Boston directory appeared in 1789,
wherein his shop was listed as being on Ann Street.</p>

<p>Hagger died in Baltimore on November 8, 1834, at the age of
65, after a residence of 18 years in that city.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Thus far only one instrument by Hagger has been found&mdash;a
wooden surveying instrument or semicircumferentor (fig. 59). It
is in the possession of the writer.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 59.&mdash;Wooden graphometer made by Benjamin King Hagger (c. 1769-1834) of Boston and Baltimore. Made of yellow

<p><i>Benjamin Warren</i></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 60.&mdash;An advertisement of Benjamin Warren in <i>The Plymouth Journal &amp;
Massachusetts Advertiser</i>. Photos courtesy The American Antiquarian Society,
Worcester, Massachusetts.]</p>

<p>Production of wooden surveying compasses was not limited to
Boston. Another instrument maker who produced them was Benjamin
Warren (c. 1740-?) of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The name
of Benjamin Warren was a fairly common one in Plymouth, being a
name handed down in the family from father to son for at least
five generations before 1800. The first Benjamin Warren at Plymouth
was married in 1697, and his son Benjamin (2) was born in
1698. Benjamin (2) was married in due course, and his son Benjamin
(3) was born in 1740. The third Benjamin was the father
of Benjamin (4), who was born in 1766. In 1789 Benjamin (4)
married Sarah Young, the daughter of Daniel Young, and their
son Benjamin (5) was born in 1792. The Benjamin Warren who
operated the shop in Plymouth probably was Benjamin Warren (3),
who was then about 45 years of age.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>A search of <i>The Plymouth Journal &amp; Massachusetts Advertiser</i> has
revealed several advertisements and notices (fig. 60) about Benjamin
Warren from which some information can be derived about
the man and his business during this period. The first known
notice dated March 19, 1785, probably is the most important one.
Later in the same year, on August 16, 1785, Warren published the
following notice:</p>

<blockquote><p>WHEREAS on Friday Morning of the 5th inst. eloped from the House of the
subscriber, <i>Inholder</i> in Plymouth, JOHN MOREY, of NORTON, of tall
stature, &amp; round shoulder'd. Had on when he absconded, a shabby claret
coloured coat, adorned with patches, and a pair of dirty smoak'd coloured
breeches; without knee-buckles; and an old flopped hatt, defaced with grease.</p>

<p>As he appeared to be an enterprising genius, without abilities, politeness or
honesty, and went off in an abrupt and clandestine manner; a reward of <i>Sixpence</i>
will be paid, to any person or persons, who will persuade or induce the
said Morey to make his appearance once more to the subscriber.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that Warren was not considerably concerned about
the return of John Morey, for the reward offered was scarcely
conducive to obtain the public's cooperation. Warren's first
ventures with public sales must have been successful, for early in
the next year, in the issue of January 3, 1786, he announced that</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Benjamin Warren</i>,</p>

<p>PROPOSES to open a convenient AUCTION-ROOM, over the Shop he now
trades in, next week. Any Gentlemen that will furnish him with goods of any
kind for Public or Private sale, on Commission, shall be served with fidelity,
and the smallest favours in that way gratefully acknowledged.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next notice of the auction-room appeared on February 21,
1786, when the newspaper advertised that</p>

<blockquote><p><i>To-morrow</i>
will be SOLD, by
Public Vendue,
At
WARREN'S
Auction Room,</p>

<p>A VARIETY of articles, <i>viz</i>. Nails, Bar Lead, Glass
Pewter, Buttons, Buckles, Chairs, Stands, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>*** The SALE to begin at 10 o'Clock, A.M.</p></blockquote>

<p>No other notices of public sales appeared in the <i>Journal</i> for the
next several months. The last notice of this period was another
announcement of a sale, which was published in the issue of May
30, 1786:</p>

<p>Only one instrument signed by Warren is known to survive;
it is a wooden surveying compass (fig. 61) in the Streeter Collection
of Weights and Measures at Yale University. The instrument,
which appears to have been made from walnut, has a compass
card with the following inscription around the central medallion:
"Made and sold by <span class="smcap">BENJAMIN WARREN</span> Plymouth New Eng<sup>d</sup>."</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 61.&mdash;Wooden surveying compass made by Benjamin Warren (c. 1740-c. 1800)

compass, made of cherry wood, is 12 in. long and has a diameter of 6 in. In
Streeter Collection of Weights and Measures, Yale University.]</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 62.&mdash;Detail of card, Warren surveying compass shown in figure 61.]</p>

<p>The medallion (fig. 62) encloses a harbor scene with a brigantine
of the 1740 period off a promontory on which is prominently
situated a lighthouse with a smaller building partly visible at the
left. The lighthouse is unusual in construction in that it features
twin towers rising from a large rectangular wooden building.</p>

<p>As far as can be determined from available records, the only
lighthouse in America of this period having such construction was
the noted Gurnet Light, which was built at the tip of Duxbury
Beach in Plymouth Bay in 1768. D. Alan Stevenson<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> relates that
the Governor's Council of Massachusetts, when it decided in 1768
to erect the Gurnet Lighthouse at Plymouth, adopted a novel plan
to distinguish it from other American lighthouses. "This consisted
of double lights set horizontally in the same structure. A timber
house built at a cost of £660, 30' long and 20' high, had a lanthorn
at each end to contain two four-wick lamps.</p>

<p>"In 1802 fire destroyed the house but the merchants of the
town promptly subscribed to replace it by temporary lights, as the
Government had no immediate funds at its disposal. An Act of
Congress of 1802 allotted $2500 for building another set of twin
lights and reimbursing the merchants for their expenditure.</p>

<p>"Though the idea of twin lights at Plymouth seemed an excellent
distinction from a single navigation light shown at Barnstable
harbor in the vicinity, they proved not entirely advantageous and
a sea captain blamed them for causing his shipwreck. He had
seen the light from only one tower and identified it with confidence
as the Barnstable light; apparently, from a particular direction
one tower hid the other. But local prejudice in favor of retaining
the twin lights as a distinction prevailed until 1924 when, at last,
opposition ceased to the recommendation which the Lighthouse
Board expressed frequently that a single light would be preferable."</p>

<p>It seems quite likely that the compass card bears one of the very
few surviving contemporary representations of the first Gurnet
Light in Plymouth Bay. A search of the archives of the historical
societies in Plymouth, Boston, and Worcester and the files of the
U.S. National Archives has failed to reveal any illustration of
this famous lighthouse.</p>

<p>Quite by coincidence, the name of Benjamin Warren was discovered
among the entries of the day books of Paul Revere, the
famous patriot, silversmith, and engraver. The entry<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> (fig. 63)
appears as follows:</p>

<p>
1786 March 13. Benjm Warren Dr. Plimouth<br />
To printing one hundred Compass Cards 0-18-0.<br />
</p>

<p>Whether the compass card on the Warren instrument was
produced by Revere is difficult to determine. Authorities on
Revere's engravings agree that it could have been engraved by
Revere but are unable to state it positively. It has been suggested
that the entry in Revere's day book indicates that he merely
printed the compass cards for Warren and that he did not engrave
a plate. The charge for the work bears out this supposition; and
furthermore, Revere's bills seemed to make a definite distinction
between the engraving of plates and actual prints. Whether or
not Revere was responsible for making the original engraving remains
to be determined, but it is very probable that he printed
the compass card of the instrument in the Streeter Collection of
Weights and Measures at Yale.</p>

<p><i>Daniel Burnap</i></p>

<p>One of the best known and most respected names among Connecticut
clockmakers is that of Daniel Burnap (1759-1838) of
East Windsor. Burnap was born in Coventry in 1759 and served
an apprenticeship with Thomas Harland, clockmaker of Norwich.
In about 1780 Burnap opened his own establishment, where he
combined the crafts of clockmaking, cabinetmaking, and engraving
of brass, in all of which he was greatly skilled. One of his apprentices
was Eli Terry, who later achieved fame in the craft in his
own right.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Burnap's business included clients in Windsor, Hartford, and
Coventry, as well as some of the leading merchants and cabinetmakers
of the nearby cities and towns. Although clockmaking
was the primary business in which Burnap engaged, he also had a
large trade for his surveying instruments, silver spoons, gold beads,
harness and saddlery hardware, and shoe buckles.</p>

<p>Burnap prospered, and in about 1800 he moved back to his
native town, Coventry. There he purchased a large farm and
erected a shop and a sawmill, and in due course became the leading
citizen of the community. He died in 1838, leaving a valuable
technological record in the completeness of his journals and
account books. A study of the entries of his day books and
ledgers (see fig. 64) reveals that Burnap did a substantial amount
of business in surveying compasses, chains, and protractors.
Among his shop equipment after his death there was found an
unfinished protractor, but no examples of his instruments are
known except for a compass dial, inscribed with his name, that
was discovered recently in the collection of a midwestern historical
society.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>It is significant to note that Burnap made instruments of varying
quality. For instance, he charged three different prices for his
surveyor's compasses. The highest-priced compasses cost £6;
they were made of brass, and were of the more elaborate conventional
type used by surveyors. A few examples that appeared in
his records cost £4; these also were made of brass, but probably
were of a simpler form. Several entries list surveying compasses
priced at £2 and £2/8. One of these was made for Capt. Solomon
Dewie (1750-1813) in September 1790 for £2/8. At the same time,
Burnap charged him £0/1/6 for touching the needle of another
compass.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The entries in Burnap's account books do not state
that these inexpensive compasses were constructed of wood, but
it seems to be sufficiently conclusive that they were.</p>


<p><i>Gurdon Huntington</i></p>

<p>Gurdon Huntington (1763-1804) was not primarily a maker
of scientific instruments, but he was established as a goldsmith
and clockmaker. He was  born  in  Windham,  Connecticut,  on
April 30, 1763, the son of Hezekiah and Submit (Murdock) Huntington.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 64.&mdash;Entry in the manuscript ledgers of Daniel Burnap (1759-1838) of
East Windsor and Coventry, Connecticut, for sale of surveying compass in
1790. Reproduced from the Burnap shop records in the collection of Connecticut
Historical Society, Hartford.]</p>

<p>The Huntington family was one of the most important in Connecticut
colonial history. Gurdon's father, Hezekiah, was in
service during the Revolutionary War, going to Boston as a
major with the first troops raised in Connecticut. When in Boston
he witnessed the miserable condition of the arms then in the
hands of the soldiers. Major Huntington went immediately to
Philadelphia, where Congress was in session, and proposed to
the Congress that he would return to his home in Windham and
that there he would open a manufactory for repairing muskets
and other arms. He claimed to have been the first man to have
made a gun in the Colonies.</p>

<p>Gurdon was too young to have served in the Revolution, but
he undoubtedly worked in his father's gun manufactory as a
boy. In due course he learned the trades of goldsmith and clockmaker
and established his own shop in Windham, which, according
to an advertisement (fig. 65) in <i>The Connecticut Gazette</i> of June
11, 1784, was "a few rods north of Major Ebenezer Backus' store."</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1785, Gurdon was married in New London
to Temperance Williams of Groton. In 1789 their first child,
Marvin, was born, and in October of the same year the Huntingtons
moved from Windham to Walpole, New Hampshire. No reason
can be found for the move, other than the possibility that Gurdon
might have anticipated greater opportunity in the new community.
There he applied himself to his trade as goldsmith and clockmaker,
but apparently he was not very successful. His family
grew, and by the time of his death there were eight children.
Possibly in an effort to supplement his income, Huntington served
as postmaster of the community. In about 1797, seven or eight
years after he had moved to Walpole, his father and mother
joined him there, and it is believed that Major Hezekiah may have
worked as a gunsmith during that period. Eventually the senior
Huntington returned to Windham, Connecticut, where he died
in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Gurdon Huntington struggled on until his death
on July 26, 1804. He died insolvent, which created a considerable
problem in view of the large family he left behind him. Huntington's
estate was administered by Asa Sibley, a clockmaker in
Walpole. Sibley had moved to Walpole from his home in Woodstock,
Connecticut, in the 1790's and he remained there until
1808, when he again returned to Woodstock. Gurdon Huntington's
widow removed to Bloomfield, Ohio, with her children, and
she died there on May 25, 1823. Most of her children settled
in Bloomfield, but several of them moved to New Hartford, New
York.</p>

<p>Several examples of Huntington's clocks are known to exist in
private collections in the United States. However, only one
example of his scientific instruments appears to have survived.
This is a surveying compass (fig. 66) made of wood, with brass
sighting bars and a painted dial under glass with a steel needle.
The dial is inscribed "<span class="smcap">G. HUNTINGTON/WALPOLE</span>." The instrument,
which is in the collection of the writer, is made of cherry wood,
with a riveted ball-and-socket joint of brass for insertion on a tripod.</p>

<p><i>Jedidiah Baldwin</i></p>

<p>Jedidiah Baldwin (fl. 1790's) was another early New England
clock and instrument maker, but little is known of his early life.
He was a brother of Jabes Baldwin (c. 1777-1829), who worked as
a clockmaker in Salem and Boston after serving an apprenticeship
with Thomas Harland in Norwich, Connecticut.</p>

<p>Jedidiah Baldwin also served an apprenticeship with Harland.
In 1791 he was working in Northampton, Massachusetts, as a
member of the firm of Stiles and Baldwin, and from 1792 to 1794
he was a member of the firm of Stiles and Storrs, in partnership
with Nathan Storrs.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In about 1794 Baldwin moved to Hanover,
New Hampshire, where he became the local postmaster, and where
Dartmouth College records his death.</p>

<p>Only one existing instrument is known to have been made by
Baldwin; it is a wooden surveying compass with a brass dial
having two scales, one for degrees and one for eight divisions
per 90°. The dial is inscribed "<span class="smcap">JED BALDWIN/HANOVER</span>." According
to its present owner, Mr. Worth Shampeny of Rochester,
Vermont, the compass was used for surveying in Vermont during
the early 1800's.</p>

<p>Another Jedidiah Baldwin worked as a clockmaker in Morrisville,
New York, from 1818-1820 and then in Fairfield, New York;
he appears also in the city directory of Rochester, New York, as a
clockmaker during the years 1834-1844. He may have been a son
or grandson of the first Jedidiah, or a nephew.</p>


<p><i>Thomas Salter Bowles</i></p>

<p>Thomas Salter Bowles (c. 1765-?) is another elusive New England
instrument maker about whom little information is available.
He is believed to have been the son of Deacon Samuel and Hannah
(Salter) Bowles, born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, probably
between 1765 and 1770. His father was born in 1739; his mother,
who was the daughter of Captain Titus Salter, was born in 1748
and died in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Deacon Bowles was clerk of the Brick Market
in Portsmouth from 1801 to the time of his death, November 3,
1802. There is a minimum of information available from church
and city records in the community, but it is believed that he was
a member of one of the offshoots of the established Puritan Church,
and hence he would not appear in its records. He kept the lower
school in the Brick School House on State Street for a number of
years.</p>

<p>It is believed that the Bowles family first came to Portsmouth
during the few years immediately before the beginning of the
Revolutionary War. It is known that a Thomas Bowles and a
Samuel Bowles both signed the Association Test on August 14,
1776, promising to oppose the hostile proceedings of the British
fleets and armies. Furthermore, one of the principal taxpayers in
Portsmouth in 1770 was a firm named Griffith and Bowles, which
paid £17 in taxes in 1770. The name of the Bowles who formed
part of this firm is not known, but it was either Samuel or the first
Thomas Bowles. The other partner was Nathaniel S. Griffith, a
watchmaker. It is possible that a tradition of instrument making
existed in the Bowles family even then.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>On file in the office of the City Clerk in Portsmouth are two
certificates of marriage made out by Thomas Salter Bowles. The
first is for his marriage to Hannah Ham, a ceremony performed on
September 21, 1809, by Joseph Walton, one of the pastors of a
church dissenting from the Puritan regime. Hannah was the
daughter of William Ham, a brother of Supply Ham (1788-1862),
a noted local clockmaker. Bowles may have served an apprenticeship
in that shop before he married Hannah. Two other members
of the Ham family&mdash;George Ham and Henry H. Ham&mdash;worked as
watchmakers in Portsmouth in the same period.</p>

<p>A search of the cemeteries has indicated that Hannah Ham
Bowles died in 1811, age 20. She is buried with her infant son in
North Cemetery.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Bowles's second marriage certificate in Portsmouth is
for his marriage on September 29, 1813&mdash;two years after Hannah's
death&mdash;to Abiah Emerly Bradley of Haverhill, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Little is known about the work of Bowles as an instrument maker
except through a few of his instruments. He is listed in the first
Portsmouth directory, of 1821, as a "mathematical instrument
maker" with a place of business on Daniel Street; his home was
given as Austin Street in Portsmouth. He did not appear in the
city's directories of 1827 and 1834. It is assumed that he may have
left Portsmouth in the interim, possibly to settle in his wife's home
town of Haverhill.</p>

<p>Three instruments signed by Bowles have survived, and all show
signs of considerable wear. They are surveying compasses made
of walnut, having maple sighting bars and a silvered brass vernier
set under the glass. Two examples, one in the Streeter Collection
of Weights and Measures at Yale University and one owned
by this writer are almost identical in size, form, and details. The
only variation is that the Yale example (fig. 67) has a bubble level
under a brass strip set into one end, an item lacking in the other
example (fig. 68).</p>

<p>The compass card, made from a line engraving, is identical in
each of the three examples. A floriated fleur-de-lis on the North
point has a compass and square at its base, and the name <span class="smcap">T. S.
BOWLES</span> is on a riband over it. Adorning the East point is an
American eagle bearing a shield with stars and stripes and clutching
arrows in one claw and a laurel twig in the other. In a ring within
the central medallion is inscribed (see fig. 68), "* <span class="smcap">T. S. BOWLES</span> *
<span class="smcap">PORTSMOUTH, N.H.</span> *"</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 67.&mdash;Wooden surveying compass made by Thomas Salter Bowles of
Portsmouth, New Hampshire. With spirit level. Made of birch, the compass
is 13 in. long and has a diameter of 6 in. In the Streeter Collection of
Weights and Measures, Yale University.]</p>

<p>The most interesting of the three instruments was acquired by
the Dartmouth Museum as part of a collection of the late Frank C.
Churchill, an inspector in the Indian Service. The instrument (fig.
69) is a quarter circle with a compass in its center and sighting bars
mounted on a swinging arm that reads the angle of the brass
scale on the arc by means of a vernier. It is mounted on a wooden
tripod with the customary ball-and-socket joint, which permits it
to be placed on a vertical plane. A built-in plumb bob at the side
helps to establish the vertical.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Interesting features of this instrument are two inscriptions engraved
on the brass strip on the top of the dial. One states that
it was "<span class="smcap">INVENTED BY P. MERRILL ESQ.</span>" and the other relates that
it was "<span class="smcap">MADE BY JOHN KENNARD NEWMARKET</span>." No information
about P. Merrill has been found, and it is presumed that it was he
who conceived the idea of combining the various elements into a
single instrument and that it was made under his direction by
Kennard.</p>

<p>Some data on Kennard is available in a history of Newfields
(formerly Newmarket) by Reverend Fitts. John Kennard was
born in Kittery, Maine, in 1782. He learned the trade of clockmaker
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, presumably working with
the members of the Ham family or others. On July 3, 1806, he
married Sarah Ewer. He lived for various periods in Nashua and
Concord before moving to Newfields in 1812. He lived in the
Palmer house (which was burned in September 1899), and he kept
a store in the little community and also served as its postmaster
from 1822 to 1824. The post office was the only public office in
the town until the cotton mills were built on the Lamprey River
in 1823. Kennard later built and occupied the Kennard house on
Piscassic Street, which was subsequently owned by Jeremiah Towle
and has since been burned. In December 1830 he established an
iron foundry together with Temple Paul and the Drake family,
but in 1834 he sold his interest to Amos Paul and others. He was
the father of six children and he died in 1861. During his lifetime
he had specialized in making tall case and banjo clocks.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>




<h2><a name="The_New_Era" id="The_New_Era"></a><i>The New Era</i></h2>


<p>The beginning of the 19th century saw increased trading and
shipping resulting from the economic development of the new
republic, and the westward surge brought increased preoccupation
with the settlement of communities and the development of land
areas. As a consequence, the demand for instruments likewise
increased.</p>

<p>Whereas during the 18th century and until some time after the
end of the Revolutionary War probably not more than a dozen
instrument makers and dealers are known to have emigrated from
England or elsewhere to make their homes and careers in the
American Colonies, the beginning of the 19th century saw substantial
numbers of English and French instrument makers and
dealers immigrate to the United States, to establish shops in the
major centers of trade.</p>

<p>And whereas the names of scarcely a hundred mathematical-instrument
makers who worked in the American Colonies during
the 18th century are known today, the names of hundreds of
similar 19th-century craftsmen and dealers are to be found.</p>

<p>As Derek Price<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> has so cogently stated: "For scientific instrument
makers, one need only examine the nineteenth century city
directories of Boston, Philadelphia and New York to find hundreds
of names of craftsmen and firms. It is, to be sure, an antiquarian
research, for one does not expect to find great discoveries coming
from these people. But just as in Europe, it is a populous trade,
influential in the growth of science and highly effective in spreading
and intensifying the itch for ingenious instruments and devices.
It is by these men that the basic skills of the Industrial Revolution
were populated...." By such means did American science and
technology come of age.</p>

<p><i>Surveying Instrument</i>, with brass disk 10-1/2 in. in diameter laid off
in degrees, minutes, and seconds with vernier points. Two telescopes,
one fixed and the other revolving. The instrument is
mounted on a tripod or Jacob's staff by means of a socket on the
underside. Complete with original painted pine case. The name
of the maker, "G. Adams London," is engraved on the dial.</p>

<p>George Adams (1704&#8212;-1773) was mathematical instrument
maker to King George III. After serving an apprenticeship from
1718, he made instruments for the East India Company in 1735
and 1736, and established a shop at "Tycho Brahe's Head" at the
corner of Raquet Court, Fleet Street. He specialized in terrestrial
and celestial globes and microscopes. Following his death he was
succeeded in business by his son George Adams the Younger
(1750-1795), who also served as mathematical-instrument maker
to the king.</p>

<p>This instrument is believed by the donor to have been used by
either Andrew Ellicott or by his son-in-law David Bates Douglass.</p>

<p>The firm of "W. &amp; S. Jones" was a partnership of two brothers,
Samuel and William Jones, opticians, who worked at 30 Lower
Holborn and at 135 Holborn in London, from 1793.    They bought
the copyright to the books of George Adams, and subsequently
largely carried on the original business of the Adams instrument
makers.</p>

<p>In <i>The Journal of Andrew Ellicott</i> its author describes this instrument
as the first of "Two Acromatic Telescopes for Taking
signals, with sliding tubes, one of them drew out to upwards
of 4 feet, and the other to about 15 inches, the latter for its length
is remarkably good, it shows the satellites of Jupiter very

<p><i>Transit and Equal Altitude Instrument</i>, made entirely of brass,
with original lens now broken. The instrument is described by
Ellicott in the following extract from <i>The Journal of Andrew
Ellicott</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Preparatory to beginning the ten mile square [of Washington] a Meridian was
traced at Jones' Point on the West of the Potomac. From this Meridian an
angle of 45 degrees was laid off North Westerly and a straight line continued
in that direction ten miles.... From the termination of this second line a
third making a right angle with it was carried South-Easterly ten miles:
and from the beginning on Jones' Point a fourth was carried ten miles to the
termination of the third. These lines were measured with a chain which
was examined and corrected daily, and plumbed whenever the ground was
uneven, and traced with a transit and equal altitude instrument which I constructed
and executed in 1789 and used in running the Western boundary of
the State of New York. This instrument was similar to that described by
Le Monnier in his preface to the French "Histoire Celeste." ... All the
lines in this city in which I have been concerned were traced with the same
instrument which I used on the lines of the ten mile square but as the Northern
part was not finished when I left that place, I cannot pretend to say what
method has since been pursued.</p></blockquote>

tube and mountings and a wooden supporting post. The tube is
suspended by trunnions at the top and swings against a graduated
arc extending north and south for measuring zenith distances in

<p>In the <i>Journal of Andrew Ellicott</i> its author referred to this

<blockquote><p>The boundary line to the North of Pennsylvania was fixed by Dr. Rittenhouse
and Captain Holland in the year 1774 and completed in 1786 and 1787.
We commenced operations by running a guide line west from the point mentioned
on the Delaware 20-1/4 miles and there corrected by the following
Zenith distances taken at its West termination by a most excellent sector constructed
and executed by Dr. Rittenhouse.</p></blockquote>

<p>The zenith sector is again mentioned in the appendix of the
<i>Journal</i>: "One Zenith Sector of nearly six feet radius similar to
the one made by Mr. [George] Graham for Dr. Bradley and Mr.
Molyneux, with which the aberrations of the stars and mutation
of the earth's axis were discovered, and the quantities determined."</p>

<p><i>Zenith Sector</i>, made of brass, original lens broken. Constructed
by David Rittenhouse with some additions made by Andrew
Ellicott. In The <i>Journal of Andrew Ellicott</i> the instrument is
described as a
Zenith Sector of 19 inches radius to be used when the utmost accuracy
was not necessary, and where the transportation of the large one could not
be effected without great expense and difficulty. These instruments were
principally executed by my late worthy and ingenious friend, Mr. Rittenhouse,
except some additions which I have made myself. The plumb lines of both
Sectors are suspended from a notch above the axis of the instruments in the
manner described by the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne, the present Astronomer
Royal at Greenwich, in the introduction to the first volume of his Astronomical
Observations. A particular description of those instruments is rendered
unnecessary by being accurately done in a number of scientific works, particularly
by M. de Maupertius in his account of the measurement of a degree
of the meridian under the Arctic Circle&mdash;The Sector is of all instruments
the best calculated for measuring zenith distances which come within its arc.
The large one above mentioned [large Zenith Sector] extends to 5 degrees
North, and South of the Zenith. Stars when so near the Zenith are insensibly
affected by the different refractive powers of the Atmosphere arising from
its different degrees of density. Add to this that the error of the visual axis
is completely corrected by taking the Zenith distances of the stars with the
plane, or face of the instrument both East and West.</p>

<p>The survey, made in compliance with the Treaty of Ghent, is
described in <i>The Collections of the Maine Historical Society</i> (Portland:
Hoyt, Fogg &amp; Donham, 1881, vol. 8, p. 20):</p>

<blockquote><p>Thomas Barclay, of whom we have heard more than once before, as a
Commissioner under the treaty, on the part of Great Britain, and Cornelius P.
Van Ness, on the part of the United States, were appointed Commissioners to
ascertain and run the line. An actual survey was arranged, and surveyors
appointed, to wit: Charles Turner, Jr., on the part of the United States, and
Colin Campbell on the part of Great Britain. About twenty miles of the
line was surveyed, then the work was discontinued, never to be resumed; but
an exploring survey was commenced by Colonel Bouchette, on the part of
Great Britain, and John Johnson, on the part of the United States. These
gentlemen made an exploring line in 1817, extending ninety-nine miles from
the monument at the head of the river St. Croix, and made separate reports of
their doings. In 1818 Mr. Johnson, with Mr. Odell, who had taken the place
of Col. Bouchette, finished running the exploring line to the Beaver or Metis

by this maker are in the National Maritime Museum and the
Whipple Museum, Cambridge.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 83.&mdash;Telescope, 62 in. long, made of wood wrapped with twine. It was
made by Benjamin Cole of London and was owned and used by Gen. George
Washington at Mount Vernon. USNM 92423.]</p>

<p>This telescope, used by General Washington at Mount Vernon,
"was kept behind the hall door and his favorite amusement was to
look out over the river with it." According to Mrs. Lewis, the
General used it to observe life on the river and especially to discover
guests approaching Mount Vernon, as many of their visitors
arrived by boat. Benjamin Latrobe, the architect, on a visit to
Mount Vernon made an amusing sketch of his host looking
anxiously up the stream for some belated dinner guests.</p>

<p>Part of the collection purchased from the Lewis heirs in 1878 by
the U.S. Government and transferred to the U.S. National Museum
in 1883. USNM 92423.      <span class="smcap">Figure</span> 83.</p>

<p><i>Survey of Land</i>, drawn and documented by George Washington
on April 2, 1751 for Thomas Loftan of Frederick County, Va.
Paper, 12 in. wide by 7-3/4 in. high.</p>

<p>This survey was made by Washington when he was 19 years of
age, and it is believed to be the only such document relating to
his earliest period as a surveyor. Washington was licensed as a
surveyor by the President and Masters of William and Mary
College in 1749. On July 20th of the same year he was appointed
surveyor in Culpepper County, Va., by Governor Dinwiddie.</p>
