Upgrading requires a complete reinstall (save header.txt and setting.rc although in
theory these should not be be overwritten).

On Windows, unzip the the file Winguts-nn.nn.nn.zip into a directory and run 
Winguts.bat. You will also need to install helper applications to view images 
and to spell check. 

For other platforms, you will need to install Perl.
