PUBLISHER'S NOTE


These essays are here reprinted from various periodicals,
running over a period of about twenty years. The
selection is due to Messrs. Leon Ardzrooni, Wesley C.
Mitchell and Walter W. Stewart.

It is unlikely that more than a few public libraries
possess files so complete as to give access to all of these
essays, and even if the magazines were readily obtainable
at libraries they would almost certainly have to be read
in those institutions. The nature of the material, its
timeliness (Mr. Veblen deals with ideas in such a manner
as to give the date of composition a secondary importance),
and the fact that it would otherwise be lost to
all save diligent excavators, explain its preservation in
this form.

THE PLACE OF SCIENCE IN MODERN
CIVILISATION[1]


It is commonly held that modern Christendom is superior
to any and all other systems of civilised life. Other ages
and other cultural regions are by contrast spoken of as
lower, or more archaic, or less mature. The claim is that
the modern culture is superior on the whole, not that it is
the best or highest in all respects and at every point. It
has, in fact, not an all-around superiority, but a superiority
within a closely limited range of intellectual activities,
while outside this range many other civilisations surpass
that of the modern occidental peoples. But the
peculiar excellence of the modern culture is of such a
nature as to give it a decisive practical advantage over all
other cultural schemes that have gone before or that have
come into competition with it. It has proved itself fit to
survive in a struggle for existence as against those civilisations
which differ from it in respect of its distinctive
traits.

Modern civilisation is peculiarly matter-of-fact. It
contains many elements that are not of this character, but
these other elements do not belong exclusively or characteristically
to it. The modern civilised peoples are in a
peculiar degree capable of an impersonal, dispassionate
insight into the material facts with which mankind has to
deal. The apex of cultural growth is at this point.
Compared with this trait the rest of what is comprised in
the cultural scheme is adventitious, or at the best it is a

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The American Journal of Sociology</i>,
Vol. XI, March, 1906.]
-----File: 010.png---\DPL\VickyC\VerenaM\alex cook\Close@Hand\-------------
by-product of this hard-headed apprehension of facts.
This quality may be a matter of habit or of racial endowment,
or it may be an outcome of both; but whatever be
the explanation of its prevalence, the immediate consequence
is much the same for the growth of civilisation.
A civilisation which is dominated by this matter-of-fact
insight must prevail against any cultural scheme that lacks
this element. This characteristic of western civilisation
comes to a head in modern science, and it finds its highest
material expression in the technology of the machine industry.
In these things modern culture is creative and
self-sufficient; and these being given, the rest of what may
seem characteristic in western civilisation follows by easy
consequence. The cultural structure clusters about this
body of matter-of-fact knowledge as its substantial core.
Whatever is not consonant with these opaque creations of
science is an intrusive feature in the modern scheme, borrowed
or standing over from the barbarian past.

Other ages and other peoples excel in other things and
are known by other virtues. In creative art, as well as in
critical taste, the faltering talent of Christendom can at
the best follow the lead of the ancient Greeks and the
Chinese. In deft workmanship the handicraftsmen of
the middle Orient, as well as of the Far East, stand on a
level securely above the highest European achievement,
old or new. In myth-making, folklore, and occult symbolism
many of the lower barbarians have achieved things
beyond what the latter-day priests and poets know how to
propose. In metaphysical insight and dialectical versatility
many orientals, as well as the Schoolmen of the
Middle Ages, easily surpass the highest reaches of the
New Thought and the Higher Criticism. In a shrewd
sense of the religious verities, as well as in an unsparing
faith in devout observances, the people of India or Thibet,
-----File: 011.png---\DPL\VickyC\Sarshi\msmoose\Close@Hand\----------------
or even the medi√¶val Christians, are past-masters in comparison
even with the select of the faith of modern times.
In political finesse, as well as in unreasoning, brute loyalty,
more than one of the ancient peoples give evidence of
a capacity to which no modern civilised nation may aspire.
In warlike malevolence and abandon, the hosts of Islam,
the Sioux Indian, and the "heathen of the northern sea"
have set the mark above the reach of the most strenuous
civilised warlord.

To modern civilised men, especially in their intervals of
sober reflection, all these things that distinguish the barbarian
civilisations seem of dubious value and are required
to show cause why they should not be slighted. It is not
so with the knowledge of facts. The making of states
and dynasties, the founding of families, the prosecution of
feuds, the propagation of creeds and the creation of sects,
the accumulation of fortunes, the consumption of superfluities--these
have all in their time been felt to justify
themselves as an end of endeavor; but in the eyes of
modern civilised men all these things seem futile in comparison
with the achievements of science. They dwindle
in men's esteem as time passes, while the achievements of
science are held higher as time passes. This is the one
secure holding-ground of latter-day conviction, that "the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men" is indefeasibly
right and good. When seen in such perspective
as will clear it of the trivial perplexities of workday life,
this proposition is not questioned within the horizon of
the western culture, and no other cultural ideal holds a
similar unquestioned place in the convictions of civilised
mankind.

On any large question which is to be disposed of for
good and all the final appeal is by common consent taken
to the scientist. The solution offered in the name of sci-*
-----File: 012.png---\DPL\VickyC\maggiemeh\alex cook\Close@Hand\-----------
*ence is decisive so long as it is not set aside by a still more
searching scientific inquiry. This state of things may not
be altogether fortunate, but such is the fact. There are
other, older grounds of finality that may conceivably be
better, nobler, worthier, more profound, more beautiful.
It might conceivably be preferable, as a matter of cultural
ideals, to leave the last word with the lawyer, the duelist,
the priest, the moralist, or the college of heraldry. In
past times people have been content to leave their weightiest
questions to the decision of some one or other of these
tribunals, and, it cannot be denied, with very happy results
in those respects that were then looked to with the greatest
solicitude. But whatever the common-sense of earlier
generations may have held in this respect, modern common-sense
holds that the scientist's answer is the only
ultimately true one. In the last resort enlightened
common-sense sticks by the opaque truth and refuses to
go behind the returns given by the tangible facts.

<i>Quasi lignum vitae in paradiso Dei, et quasi lucerna
fulgoris in domo Domini</i>, such is the place of science in
modern civilisation. This latterday faith in matter-of-fact
knowledge may be well grounded or it may not. It
has come about that men assign it this high place, perhaps
idolatrously, perhaps to the detriment of the best and most
intimate interests of the race. There is room for much
more than a vague doubt that this cult of science is not
altogether a wholesome growth--that the unmitigated
quest of knowledge, of this matter-of-fact kind, makes for
race-deterioration and discomfort on the whole, both in its
immediate effects upon the spiritual life of mankind, and
in the material consequences that follow from a great
advance in matter-of-fact knowledge.

But we are not here concerned with the merits of the
case. The question here is: How has this cult of science
-----File: 013.png---\DPL\griff4\maggiemeh\alex cook\Close@Hand\-----------
arisen? What are its cultural antecedents? How far
is it in consonance with hereditary human nature? and,
What is the nature of its hold on the convictions of
civilised men?

<tb>

In dealing with pedagogical problems and the theory of
education, current psychology is nearly at one in saying
that all learning is of a "pragmatic" character; that
knowledge is inchoate action inchoately directed to an
end; that all knowledge is "functional"; that it is of the
nature of use. This, of course, is only a corollary under
the main postulate of the latter-day psychologists, whose
catchword is that The Idea is essentially active. There is
no need of quarreling with this "pragmatic" school of
psychologists. Their aphorism may not contain the whole
truth, perhaps, but at least it goes nearer to the heart of
the epistemological problem than any earlier formulation.
It may confidently be said to do so because, for one thing,
its argument meets the requirements of modern science.
It is such a concept as matter-of-fact science can make
effective use of; it is drawn in terms which are, in the
last analysis, of an impersonal, not to say tropismatic,
character; such as is demanded by science, with its insistence
on opaque cause and effect. While knowledge is
construed in teleological terms, in terms of personal interest
and attention, this teleological aptitude is itself reducible
to a product of unteleological natural selection. The
teleological bent of intelligence is an hereditary trait
settled upon the race by the selective action of forces that
look to no end. The foundations of pragmatic intelligence
are not pragmatic, nor even personal or sensible.

This impersonal character of intelligence is, of course,
most evident on the lower levels of life. If we follow
Mr. Loeb, e. g., in his inquiries into the psychology of
-----File: 014.png---\DPL\griff4\maggiemeh\alex cook\Close@Hand\-----------
that life that lies below the threshold of intelligence, what
we meet with is an aimless but unwavering motor response
to stimulus.[2] The response is of the nature of motor impulse,
and in so far it is "pragmatic," if that term may
fairly be applied to so rudimentary a phase of sensibility.
The responding organism may be called an "agent" in so
far. It is only by a figure of speech that these terms are
made to apply to tropismatic reactions. Higher in the
scale of sensibility and nervous complication instincts
work to a somewhat similar outcome. On the human
plane, intelligence (the selective effect of inhibitive complication)
may throw the response into the form of a reasoned
line of conduct looking to an outcome that shall
be expedient for the agent. This is na√Øve pragmatism of
the developed kind. There is no longer a question but
that the responding organism is an "agent" and that
his intelligent response to stimulus is of a teleological
character. But that is not all. The inhibitive nervous
complication may also detach another chain of response
to the given stimulus, which does not spend itself in a line
of motor conduct and does not fall into a system of uses.
Pragmatically speaking, this outlying chain of response is
unintended and irrelevant. Except in urgent cases, such
an idle response seems commonly to be present as a subsidiary
phenomenon. If credence is given to the view
that intelligence is, in its elements, of the nature of an
inhibitive selection, it seems necessary to assume some
such chain of idle and irrelevant response to account for
the further course of the elements eliminated in giving
the motor response the character of a reasoned line of
conduct. So that associated with the pragmatic attention
there is found more or less of an irrelevant atten-*

[Footnote 2: Jacques Loeb, <i>Heliotropismus der Thiere</i>, and <i>Comparative
Psychology and Physiology of the Brain</i>.]
-----File: 015.png---\DPL\The Dougal\maggiemeh\alex cook\Close@Hand\-------
*tion, or idle curiosity. This is more particularly the case
where a higher range of intelligence is present. This idle
curiosity is, perhaps, closely related to the aptitude for
play, observed both in man and in the lower animals.[3]
The aptitude for play, as well as the functioning of idle
curiosity, seems peculiarly lively in the young, whose
aptitude for sustained pragmatism is at the same time
relatively vague and unreliable.

This idle curiosity formulates its response to stimulus,
not in terms of an expedient line of conduct, nor even
necessarily in a chain of motor activity, but in terms of
the sequence of activities going on in the observed phenomena.
The "interpretation" of the facts under the
guidance of this idle curiosity may take the form of
anthropomorphic or animistic explanations of the "conduct"
of the objects observed. The interpretation of
the facts takes a dramatic form. The facts are conceived
in an animistic way, and a pragmatic animus is imputed
to them. Their behavior is construed as a reasoned
procedure on their part looking to the advantage of these
animistically conceived objects, or looking to the achievement
of some end which these objects are conceived to
have at heart for reasons of their own.

Among the savage and lower barbarian peoples there
is commonly current a large body of knowledge organised
in this way into myths and legends, which need have no
pragmatic value for the learner of them and no intended
bearing on his conduct of practical affairs. They may
come to have a practical value imputed to them as a
ground of superstitious observances, but they may also
not.[4] All students of the lower cultures are aware of

[Footnote 3: Cf. Gross, <i>Spiele der Thiere</i>, chap. 2 (esp. pp. 65-76), and
chap. 5; <i>The Play of Man</i>, Part III, sec. 3; Spencer, <i>Principles of
Psychology</i>, secs. 533-35.]

[Footnote 4: The myths and legendary lore of the Eskimo, the Pueblo]*
-----File: 016.png---\DPL\griff4\maggiemeh\msmoose\Close@Hand\-------------
the dramatic character of the myths current among these
peoples, and they are also aware that, particularly among
the peaceable communities, the great body of mythical
lore is of an idle kind, as having very little intended bearing
on the practical conduct of those who believe in these
myth-dramas. The myths on the one hand, and the workday
knowledge of uses, materials, appliances, and expedients
on the other hand, may be nearly independent of
one another. Such is the case in an especial degree
among those peoples who are prevailingly of a peaceable
habit of life, among whom the myths have not in any
great measure been canonised into precedents of divine
malevolence.

The lower barbarian's knowledge of the phenomena of
nature, in so far as they are made the subject of deliberate
speculation and are organised into a consistent body,
is of the nature of life-histories. This body of knowledge
is in the main organised under the guidance of an
idle curiosity. In so far as it is systematised under the
canons of curiosity rather than of expediency, the test
of truth applied throughout this body of barbarian knowledge
is the test of dramatic consistency. In addition to
their dramatic cosmology and folk legends, it is needless
to say, these peoples have also a considerable body of
worldly wisdom in a more or less systematic form. In
this the test of validity is usefulness.[5]

*[Footnote: Indians, and some tribes of the northwest coast afford good instances
of such idle creations. Cf. various <i>Reports</i> of the Bureau
of American Ethnology; also, e.g., Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
esp. the chapters on "Mythology" and "Animism."]

[Footnote 5: "Pragmatic" is here used in a more restricted sense than
the distinctively pragmatic school of modern psychologists would
commonly assign the term. "Pragmatic," "teleological," and the
like terms have been extended to cover imputation of purpose as
well as conversion to use. It is not intended to criticise this
ambiguous use of terms, nor to correct it; but the terms are]*
-----File: 017.png---\DPL\griff4\maggiemeh\alex cook\Close@Hand\-----------

The pragmatic knowledge of the early days differs
scarcely at all in character from that of the maturest
phases of culture. Its highest achievements in the direction
of systematic formulation consist of didactic exhortations
to thrift, prudence, equanimity, and shrewd
management--a body of maxims of expedient conduct.
In this field there is scarcely a degree of advance from
Confucius to Samuel Smiles. Under the guidance of the
idle curiosity, on the other hand, there has been a continued
advance toward a more and more comprehensive
system of knowledge. With the advance in intelligence
and experience there come closer observation and more
detailed analysis of facts.[6] The dramatisation of the
sequence of phenomena may then fall into somewhat less
personal, less anthropomorphic formulations of the processes
observed; but at no stage of its growth--at least
at no stage hitherto reached--does the output of this
work of the idle curiosity lose its dramatic character.
Comprehensive generalisations are made and cosmologies
are built up, but always in dramatic form. General principles
of explanation are settled on, which in the earlier
days of theoretical speculation seem invariably to run back
to the broad vital principle of generation. Procreation,
birth, growth, and decay constitute the cycle of postulates
within which the dramatised processes of natural
phenomena run their course. Creation is procreation in
these archaic theoretical systems, and causation is gesta-*

*[Footnote: here used only in the latter sense, which alone belongs to them
by force of early usage and etymology. "Pragmatic" knowledge,
therefore, is such as is designed to serve an expedient end
for the knower, and is here contrasted with the imputation of
expedient conduct to the facts observed. The reason for preserving
this distinction is simply the present need of a simple
term by which to mark the distinction between worldly wisdom
and idle learning.]

[Footnote 6: Cf. Ward, <i>Pure Sociology</i>, esp. pp. 437-48.]
-----File: 018.png---\DPL\griff4\maggiemeh\alex cook\mle\------------------
*tion and birth. The archaic cosmological schemes of
Greece, India, Japan, China, Polynesia, and America, all
run to the same general effect on this head.[7] The like
seems true for the Elohistic elements in the Hebrew scriptures.

Throughout this biological speculation there is present,
obscurely in the background, the tacit recognition of a
material causation, such as conditions the vulgar operations
of workday life from hour to hour. But this causal
relation between vulgar work and product is vaguely
taken for granted and not made a principle for comprehensive
generalisations. It is overlooked as a trivial matter
of course. The higher generalisations take their
color from the broader features of the current scheme of
life. The habits of thought that rule in the working-out
of a system of knowledge are such as are fostered by
the more impressive affairs of life, by the institutional
structure under which the community lives. So long as
the ruling institutions are those of blood-relationship,
descent, and clannish discrimination, so long the canons
of knowledge are of the same complexion.

When presently a transformation is made in the scheme
of culture from peaceable life with sporadic predation to
a settled scheme of predaceous life, involving mastery
and servitude, gradations of privilege and honor, coercion
and personal dependence, then the scheme of knowledge
undergoes an analogous change. The predaceous, or
higher barbarian, culture is, for the present purpose,
peculiar in that it is ruled by an accentuated pragmatism.
The institutions of this cultural phase are conventionalised
relations of force and fraud. The questions of life
are questions of expedient conduct as carried on under
the current relations of mastery and subservience. The

[Footnote 7: Cf., e. g., Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>, chap. 8.]
-----File: 019.png---\DPL\dmc1423\majolo\alex cook\mle\--------------------
habitual distinctions are distinctions of personal force,
advantage, precedence, and authority. A shrewd adaptation
to this system of graded dignity and servitude becomes
a matter of life and death, and men learn to think
in these terms as ultimate and definitive. The system
of knowledge, even in so far as its motives are of a dispassionate
or idle kind, falls into the like terms, because
such are the habits of thought and the standards of discrimination
enforced by daily life.[8]

The theoretical work of such a cultural era, as, for instance,
the Middle Ages, still takes the general shape of
dramatisation, but the postulates of the dramaturgic
theories and the tests of theoretic validity are no longer
the same as before the scheme of graded servitude came
to occupy the field. The canons which guide the work
of the idle curiosity are no longer those of generation,
blood-relationship, and homely life, but rather those of
graded dignity, authenticity, and dependence. The higher
generalisations take on a new complexion, it may be without
formally discarding the older articles of belief. The
cosmologies of these higher barbarians are cast in terms
of a feudalistic hierarchy of agents and elements, and
the causal nexus between phenomena is conceived animistically
after the manner of sympathetic magic. The
laws that are sought to be discovered in the natural universe
are sought in terms of authoritative enactment.
The relation in which the deity, or deities, are conceived to
stand to facts is no longer the relation of progenitor, so
much as that of suzerainty. Natural laws are corollaries
under the arbitrary rules of status imposed on the natural
universe by an all-powerful Providence with a view to
the maintenance of his own prestige. The science that
grows in such a spiritual environment is of the class

[Footnote 8: Cf. James, <i>Psychology</i>, chap. 9, esp. sec. 5.]
-----File: 020.png---\DPL\Tdslk\majolo\alex cook\mle\----------------------
represented by alchemy and astrology, in which the imputed
degree of nobility and prepotency of the objects and
the symbolic force of their names are looked to for an
explanation of what takes place.

The theoretical output of the Schoolmen has necessarily
an accentuated pragmatic complexion, since the
whole cultural scheme under which they lived and worked
was of a strenuously pragmatic character. The current
concepts of things were then drawn in terms of expediency,
personal force, exploit, prescriptive authority, and
the like, and this range of concepts was by force of habit
employed in the correlation of facts for purposes of
knowledge even where no immediate practical use of the
knowledge so gained was had in view. At the same time
a very large proportion of the scholastic researches and
speculations aimed directly at rules of expedient conduct,
whether it took the form of a philosophy of life under
temporal law and custom, or of a scheme of salvation under
the decrees of an autocratic Providence. A na√Øve
apprehension of the dictum that all knowledge is pragmatic
would find more satisfactory corroboration in the
intellectual output of scholasticism than in any system
of knowledge of an older or a later date.

With the advent of modern times a change comes over
the nature of the inquiries and formulations worked out
under the guidance of the idle curiosity--which from
this epoch is often spoken of as the scientific spirit. The
change in question is closely correlated with an analogous
change in institutions and habits of life, particularly with
the changes which the modern era brings in industry and
in the economic organisation of society. It is doubtful
whether the characteristic intellectual interests and teachings
of the new era can properly be spoken of as less
"pragmatic," as that term is sometimes understood, than
-----File: 021.png---\DPL\Tdslk\maggiemeh\alex cook\mle\-------------------
those of the scholastic times; but they are of another
kind, being conditioned by a different cultural and industrial
situation.[9] In the life of the new era conceptions
of authentic rank and differential dignity have grown
weaker in practical affairs, and notions of preferential
reality and authentic tradition similarly count for less in
the new science. The forces at work in the external
world are conceived in a less animistic manner, although
anthropomorphism still prevails, at least to the degree
required in order to give a dramatic interpretation of the
sequence of phenomena.

The changes in the cultural situation which seem to
have had the most serious consequences for the methods
and animus of scientific inquiry are those changes that
took place in the field of industry. Industry in early
modern times is a fact of relatively greater preponderance,
more of a tone-giving factor, than it was under the
regime of feudal status. It is the characteristic trait
of the modern culture, very much as exploit and fealty
were the characteristic cultural traits of the earlier time.
This early-modern industry is, in an obvious and convincing
degree, a matter of workmanship. The same has
not been true in the same degree either before or since.
The workman, more or less skilled and with more or less
specialised efficiency, was the central figure in the cultural
situation of the time; and so the concepts of the
scientists came to be drawn in the image of the workman.
The dramatisations of the sequence of external

[Footnote 9: As currently employed, the term "pragmatic" is made to
cover both conduct looking to the agent's preferential advantage,
expedient conduct, and workmanship directed to the production
of things that may or may not be of advantage to the agent. If
the term be taken in the latter meaning, the culture of modern
times is no less "pragmatic" than that of the Middle Ages. It
is here intended to be used in the former sense.]
-----File: 022.png---\DPL\Tdslk\maggiemeh\alex cook\mle\-------------------
phenomena worked out under the impulse of the idle
curiosity were then conceived in terms of workmanship.
Workmanship gradually supplanted differential dignity
as the authoritative canon of scientific truth, even on the
higher levels of speculation and research. This, of
course, amounts to saying in other words that the law of
cause and effect was given the first place, as contrasted
with dialectical consistency and authentic tradition. But
this early-modern law of cause and effect--the law of
efficient causes--is of an anthropomorphic kind. "Like
causes produce like effects," in much the same sense as
the skilled workman's product is like the workman;
"nothing is found in the effect that was not contained in
the cause," in much the same manner.

These dicta are, of course, older than modern science,
but it is only in the early days of modern science that
they come to rule the field with an unquestioned sway and
to push the higher grounds of dialectical validity to one
side. They invade even the highest and most recondite
fields of speculation, so that at the approach to the transition
from the early-modern to the late-modern period, in
the eighteenth century, they determine the outcome even
in the counsels of the theologians. The deity, from having
been in medi√¶val times primarily a suzerain concerned
with the maintenance of his own prestige, becomes primarily
a creator engaged in the workmanlike occupation
of making things useful for man. His relation to man
and the natural universe is no longer primarily that of
a progenitor, as it is in the lower barbarian culture, but
rather that of a talented mechanic. The "natural laws"
which the scientists of that era make so much of are no
longer decrees of a preternatural legislative authority,
but rather details of the workshop specifications handed
down by the master-craftsman for the guidance of handi-*
-----File: 023.png---\DPL\Tdslk\maggiemeh\alex cook\mle\-------------------
*craftsmen working out his designs. In the eighteenth-century
science these natural laws are laws specifying the
sequence of cause and effect, and will bear characterisation
as a dramatic interpretation of the activity of the
causes at work, and these causes are conceived in a quasi-personal
manner. In later modern times the formulations
of causal sequence grow more impersonal and more
objective, more matter-of-fact; but the imputation of
activity to the observed objects never ceases, and even
in the latest and maturest formulations of scientific research
the dramatic tone is not wholly lost. The causes
at work are conceived in a highly impersonal way, but
hitherto no science (except ostensibly mathematics) has
been content to do its theoretical work in terms of inert
magnitude alone. Activity continues to be imputed to
the phenomena with which science deals; and activity is,
of course, not a fact of observation, but is imputed to
the phenomena by the observer.[10] This is, also of course,
denied by those who insist on a purely mathematical
formulation of scientific theories, but the denial is maintained
only at the cost of consistency. Those eminent
authorities who speak for a colorless mathematical formulation
invariably and necessarily fall back on the (essentially
metaphysical) preconception of causation as soon
as they go into the actual work of scientific inquiry.[11]

Since the machine technology has made great advances,
during the nineteenth century, and has become a cultural
force of wide-reaching consequence, the formulations of

for the purpose of organising them into a dramatically consistent
system.]

his ideal of inert magnitudes as set forth in his exposition with

in his discussions of "Mother Right" and related topics
in <i>The Chances of Death</i>.]
-----File: 024.png---\DPL\Tdslk\wilburn0\msmoose\mle\----------------------
science have made another move in the direction of impersonal
matter-of-fact. The machine process has displaced
the workman as the archetype in whose image
causation is conceived by the scientific investigators. The
dramatic interpretation of natural phenomena has thereby
become less anthropomorphic; it no longer constructs the
life-history of a cause working to produce a given effect--after
the manner of a skilled workman producing a
piece of wrought goods--but it constructs the life-history
of a process in which the distinction between cause
and effect need scarcely be observed in an itemised and
specific way, but in which the run of causation unfolds
itself in an unbroken sequence of cumulative change.
By contrast with the pragmatic formulations of worldly
wisdom these latter-day theories of the scientists appear
highly opaque, impersonal, and matter-of-fact; but taken
by themselves they must be admitted still to show the
constraint of the dramatic prepossessions that once guided
the savage myth-makers.

In so far as touches the aims and the animus of scientific
inquiry, as seen from the point of view of the
scientist, it is a wholly fortuitous and insubstantial coincidence
that much of the knowledge gained under machine-made
canons of research can be turned to practical
account. Much of this knowledge is useful, or may
be made so, by applying it to the control of the processes
in which natural forces are engaged. This employment
of scientific knowledge for useful ends is technology, in
the broad sense in which the term includes, besides the
machine industry proper, such branches of practice as
engineering, agriculture, medicine, sanitation, and economic
reforms. The reason why scientific theories can
be turned to account for these practical ends is not that
these ends are included in the scope of scientific inquiry.
-----File: 025.png---\DPL\Tdslk\shadow_reader\alex cook\mle\---------------
These useful purposes lie outside the scientist's interest.
It is not that he aims, or can aim, at technological improvements.
His inquiry is as "idle" as that of the
Pueblo myth-maker. But the canons of validity under
whose guidance he works are those imposed by the modern
technology, through habituation to its requirements;
and therefore his results are available for the technological
purpose. His canons of validity are made for him
by the cultural situation; they are habits of thought imposed
on him by the scheme of life current in the community
in which he lives; and under modern conditions
this scheme of life is largely machine-made. In the modern
culture, industry, industrial processes, and industrial
products have progressively gained upon humanity, until
these creations of man's ingenuity have latterly come to
take the dominant place in the cultural scheme; and it is
not too much to say that they have become the chief
force in shaping men's daily life, and therefore the chief
factor in shaping men's habits of thought. Hence men
have learned to think in the terms in which the technological
processes act. This is particularly true of those men
who by virtue of a peculiarly strong susceptibility in this
direction become addicted to that habit of matter-of-fact
inquiry that constitutes scientific research.

Modern technology makes use of the same range of
concepts, thinks in the same terms, and applies the same
tests of validity as modern science. In both, the terms
of standardisation, validity, and finality are always terms
of impersonal sequence, not terms of human nature or
of preternatural agencies. Hence the easy copartnership
between the two. Science and technology play into one
another's hands. The processes of nature with which
science deals and which technology turns to account, the
sequence of changes in the external world, animate and
-----File: 026.png---\DPL\Tdslk\shadow_reader\alex cook\mle\---------------
inanimate, run in terms of brute causation, as do the
theories of science. These processes take no thought of
human expediency or inexpediency. To make use of
them they must be taken as they are, opaque and unsympathetic.
Technology, therefore, has come to proceed
on an interpretation of these phenomena in mechanical
terms, not in terms of imputed personality nor even of
workmanship. Modern science, deriving its concepts
from the same source, carries on its inquiries and states
its conclusions in terms of the same objective character
as those employed by the mechanical engineer.

So it has come about, through the progressive change
of the ruling habits of thought in the community, that
the theories of science have progressively diverged from
the formulations of pragmatism, ever since the modern
era set in. From an organisation of knowledge on the
basis of imputed personal or animistic propensity the
theory has changed its base to an imputation of brute
activity only, and this latter is conceived in an increasingly
matter-of-fact manner; until, latterly, the pragmatic
range of knowledge and the scientific are more widely out
of touch than ever, differing not only in aim, but in matter
as well. In both domains knowledge runs in terms of
activity, but it is on the one hand knowledge of what had
best be done, and on the other hand knowledge of what
takes place; on the one hand knowledge of ways and
means, on the other hand knowledge without any ulterior
purpose. The latter range of knowledge may serve the
ends of the former, but the converse does not hold true.

These two divergent ranges of inquiry are to be found
together in all phases of human culture. What distinguishes
the present phase is that the discrepancy between
the two is now wider than ever before. The present is
nowise distinguished above other cultural eras by any
-----File: 027.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
exceptional urgency or acumen in the search for pragmatic
expedients. Neither is it safe to assert that the
present excels all other civilisations in the volume or
the workmanship of that body of knowledge that is to
be credited to the idle curiosity. What distinguishes the
present in these premises is (1) that the primacy in the
cultural scheme has passed from pragmatism to a disinterested
inquiry whose motive is idle curiosity, and (2)
that in the domain of the latter the making of myths and
legends in terms of imputed personality, as well as the
construction of dialectical systems in terms of differential
reality, has yielded the first place to the making of theories
in terms of matter-of-fact sequence.[12]

Pragmatism creates nothing but maxims of expedient
conduct. Science creates nothing but theories.[13] It
knows nothing of policy or utility, of better or worse.
None of all that is comprised in what is to-day accounted
scientific knowledge. Wisdom and proficiency of the
pragmatic sort does not contribute to the advance of a
knowledge of fact. It has only an incidental bearing on
scientific research, and its bearing is chiefly that of inhibition
and misdirection. Wherever canons of expediency
are intruded into or are attempted to be incorporated in
the inquiry, the consequence is an unhappy one for science,
however happy it may be for some other purpose
extraneous to science. The mental attitude of worldly
wisdom is at cross-purposes with the disinterested scientific
spirit, and the pursuit of it induces an intellectual
bias that is incompatible with scientific insight. Its intellectual
output is a body of shrewd rules of conduct, in
great part designed to take advantage of human infirmity.

[Footnote 12: Cf. James, <i>Psychology</i>, Vol. II, chap. 28, pp. 633-71, esp. p.
640 note.]

[Footnote 13: Cf. Ward, <i>Principles of Psychology</i>, pp. 439-43.]
-----File: 028.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
Its habitual terms of standarisation[**standardisation?] and validity are terms
of human nature, of human preference, prejudice, aspiration,
endeavor, and disability, and the habit of mind
that goes with it is such as is consonant with these terms.
No doubt, the all-pervading pragmatic animus of the older
and non-European civilisations has had more than anything
else to do with their relatively slight and slow advance
in scientific knowledge. In the modern scheme of
knowledge it holds true, in a similar manner and with
analogous effect, that training in divinity, in law, and in
the related branches of diplomacy, business tactics, military
affairs, and political theory, is alien to the skeptical
scientific spirit and subversive of it.

The modern scheme of culture comprises a large body
of worldly wisdom, as well as of science. This pragmatic
lore stands over against science with something of a jealous
reserve. The pragmatists value themselves somewhat
on being useful as well as being efficient for good
and evil. They feel the inherent antagonism between
themselves and the scientists, and look with some doubt
on the latter as being merely decorative triflers, although
they sometimes borrow the prestige of the name of science--as
is only good and well, since it is of the essence of
worldly wisdom to borrow anything that can be turned
to account. The reasoning in these fields turns about
questions of personal advantage of one kind or another,
and the merits of the claims canvassed in these discussions
are decided on grounds of authenticity. Personal
claims make up the subject of the inquiry, and these
claims are construed and decided in terms of precedent
and choice, use and wont, prescriptive authority, and the
like. The higher reaches of generalisation in these pragmatic
inquiries are of the nature of deductions from authentic
tradition, and the training in this class of reason-*
-----File: 029.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
*ing gives discrimination in respect of authenticity and
expediency. The resulting habit of mind is a bias for
substituting dialectical distinctions and decisions <i>de jure</i>
in the place of explanations <i>de facto</i>. The so-called "sciences"
associated with these pragmatic disciplines, such
as jurisprudence, political science, and the like, are a
taxonomy of credenda. Of this character was the greater
part of the "science" cultivated by the Schoolmen, and
large remnants of the same kind of authentic convictions
are, of course, still found among the tenets of the scientists,
particularly in the social sciences, and no small
solicitude is still given to their cultivation. Substantially
the same value as that of the temporal pragmatic
inquiries belongs also, of course, to the "science" of
divinity. Here the questions to which an answer is
sought, as well as the aim and method of inquiry, are of
the same pragmatic character, although the argument runs
on a higher plane of personality, and seeks a solution in
terms of a remoter and more metaphysical expediency.

<tb>

In the light of what has been said above, the questions
recur: How far is the scientific quest of matter-of-fact
knowledge consonant with the inherited intellectual aptitudes
and propensities of the normal man? and, What
foothold has science in the modern culture? The former
is a question of the temperamental heritage of civilised
mankind, and therefore it is in large part a question of
the circumstances which have in the past selectively
shaped the human nature of civilised mankind. Under
the barbarian culture, as well as on the lower levels of
what is currently called civilised life, the dominant note
has been that of competitive expediency for the individual
or the group, great or small, in an avowed struggle for
the means of life. Such is still the ideal of the politician
-----File: 030.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
and business man, as well as of other classes whose habits
of life lead them to cling to the inherited barbarian traditions.
The upper-barbarian and lower-civilised culture,
as has already been indicated, is pragmatic, with a thoroughness
that nearly bars out any non-pragmatic ideal of
life or of knowledge. Where this tradition is strong
there is but a precarious chance for any consistent effort
to formulate knowledge in other terms than those drawn
from the prevalent relations of personal mastery and subservience
and the ideals of personal gain.

During the Dark and Middle Ages, for instance, it is
true in the main that any movement of thought not controlled
by considerations of expediency and conventions
of status are to be found only in the obscure depths of
vulgar life, among those neglected elements of the population
that lived below the reach of the active class struggle.
What there is surviving of this vulgar, non-pragmatic
intellectual output takes the form of legends and
folk-tales, often embroidered on the authentic documents
of the Faith. These are less alien to the latest and highest
culture of Christendom than are the dogmatic, dialectical,
and chivalric productions that occupied the attention
of the upper classes in medi√¶val times. It may seem
a curious paradox that the latest and most perfect flower
of the western civilisation is more nearly akin to the
spiritual life of the serfs and villeins than it is to that of
the grange or the abbey. The courtly life and the chivalric
habits of thought of that past phase of culture have
left as nearly no trace in the cultural scheme of later modern
times as could well be. Even the romancers who
ostensibly rehearse the phenomena of chivalry, unavoidably
make their knights and ladies speak the language
and the sentiments of the slums of that time, tempered
with certain schematised modern reflections and specu-*
-----File: 031.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
*lations. The gallantries, the genteel inanities and devout
imbecilities of medi√¶val high-life would be insufferable
even to the meanest and most romantic modern intelligence.
So that in a later, less barbarian age the precarious
remnants of folklore that have come down through
that vulgar channel--half savage and more than half
pagan--are treasured as containing the largest spiritual
gains which the barbarian ages of Europe have to offer.

The sway of barbarian pragmatism has, everywhere in
the western world, been relatively brief and relatively
light; the only exceptions would be found in certain parts
of the Mediterranean seaboard. But wherever the barbarian
culture has been sufficiently long-lived and unmitigated
to work out a thoroughly selective effect in the
human material subjected to it, there the pragmatic
animus may be expected to have become supreme and
to inhibit all movement in the direction of scientific inquiry
and eliminate all effective aptitude for other than
worldly wisdom. What the selective consequences of
such a protracted r√©gime of pragmatism would be for the
temper of the race may be seen in the human flotsam left
by the great civilisations of antiquity, such as Egypt, India,
and Persia. Science is not at home among these
leavings of barbarism. In these instances of its long and
unmitigated dominion the barbarian culture has selectively
worked out a temperamental bias and a scheme of
life from which objective, matter-of-fact knowledge is
virtually excluded in favor of pragmatism, secular and
religious. But for the greater part of the race, at least
for the greater part of civilised mankind, the r√©gime of
the mature barbarian culture has been of relatively short
duration, and has had a correspondingly superficial and
transient selective effect. It has not had force and time
to eliminate certain elements of human nature handed
-----File: 032.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
down from an earlier phase of life, which are not in full
consonance with the barbarian animus or with the demands
of the pragmatic scheme of thought. The barbarian-pragmatic
habit of mind, therefore, is not properly
speaking a temperamental trait of the civilised peoples,
except possibly within certain class limits (as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
German nobility). It is rather a tradition, and it does
not constitute so tenacious a bias as to make head against
the strongly materialistic drift of modern conditions and
set aside that increasingly urgent resort to matter-of-fact
conceptions that makes for the primacy of science. Civilised
mankind does not in any great measure take back
atavistically to the upper-barbarian habit of mind. Barbarism
covers too small a segment of the life-history of
the race to have given an enduring temperamental result.
The unmitigated discipline of the higher barbarism in
Europe fell on a relatively small proportion of the population,
and in the course of time this select element of the
population was crossed and blended with the blood of the
lower elements whose life always continued to run in the
ruts of savagery rather than in those of the high-strung,
finished barbarian culture that gave rise to the chivalric
scheme of life.

Of the several phases of human culture the most protracted,
and the one which has counted for most in shaping
the abiding traits of the race, is unquestionably that
of savagery. With savagery, for the purpose in hand,
is to be classed that lower, relatively peaceable barbarism
that is not characterised by wide and sharp class discrepancies
or by an unremitting endeavor of one individual
or group to get the better of another. Even under
the full-grown barbarian culture--as, for instance, during
the Middle Ages--the habits of life and the spiritual
interests of the great body of the population continue in
-----File: 033.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
large measure to bear the character of savagery. The
savage phase of culture accounts for by far the greater
portion of the life-history of mankind, particularly if the
lower barbarism and the vulgar life of later barbarism
be counted in with savagery, as in a measure they properly
should. This is particularly true of those racial
elements that have entered into the composition of the
leading peoples of Christendom.

The savage culture is characterised by the relative absence
of pragmatism from the higher generalisations of
its knowledge and beliefs. As has been noted above, its
theoretical creations are chiefly of the nature of mythology
shading off into folklore. This genial spinning
of apocryphal yarns is, at its best, an amiably inefficient
formulation of experiences and observations in terms of
something like a life-history of the phenomena observed.
It has, on the one hand, little value, and little purpose,
in the way of pragmatic expediency, and so it is not closely
akin to the pragmatic-barbarian scheme of life; while,
on the other hand, it is also ineffectual as a systematic
knowledge of matter-of-fact. It is a quest of knowledge,
perhaps of systematic knowledge, and it is carried on
under the incentive of the idle curiosity. In this respect
it falls in the same class with the civilised man's science;
but it seeks knowledge not in terms of opaque matter-of-fact,
but in terms of some sort of spiritual life imputed
to the facts. It is romantic and Hegelian rather than
realistic and Darwinian. The logical necessities of its
scheme of thought are necessities of spiritual consistency
rather than of quantitative equivalence. It is like science
in that it has no ulteriar[**ulterior?] motive beyond the idle craving
for a systematic correlation of data; but it is unlike science
in that its standardisation and correlation of data
run in terms of the free play of imputed personal initia-*
-----File: 034.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
*tive rather than in terms of the constraint of objective
cause and effect.

By force of the protracted selective discipline of this
past phase of culture, the human nature of civilised mankind
is still substantially the human nature of savage man.
The ancient equipment of congenital aptitudes and propensities
stands over substantially unchanged, though
overlaid with barbarian traditions and conventionalities
and readjusted by habituation to the exigencies of civilised
life. In a measure, therefore, but by no means
altogether, scientific inquiry is native to civilised man
with his savage heritage, since scientific inquiry proceeds
on the same general motive of idle curiosity as guided the
savage myth-makers, though it makes use of concepts and
standards in great measure alien to the myth-makers'
habit of mind. The ancient human predilection for discovering
a dramatic play of passion and intrigue in the
phenomena of nature still asserts itself. In the most
advanced communities, and even among the adepts of
modern science, there comes up persistently the revulsion
of the native savage against the inhumanly dispassionate
sweep of the scientific quest, as well as against the inhumanly
ruthless fabric of technological processes that have
come out of this search for matter-of-fact knowledge.
Very often the savage need of a spiritual interpretation
(dramatisation) of phenomena breaks through the crust
of acquired materialistic habits of thought, to find such
refuge as may be had in articles of faith seized on and
held by sheer force of instinctive conviction. Science
and its creations are more or less uncanny, more or less
alien, to that fashion of craving for knowledge that by
ancient inheritance animates mankind. Furtively or by
an overt breach of consistency, men still seek comfort
in marvelous articles of savage-born lore, which contra-*
-----File: 035.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
*dict the truths of that modern science whose dominion
they dare not question, but whose findings at the same
time go beyond the breaking point of their jungle-fed
spiritual sensibilities.

The ancient ruts of savage thought and conviction are
smooth and easy; but however sweet and indispensable
the archaic ways of thinking may be to the civilised man's
peace of mind, yet such is the binding force of matter-of-fact
analysis and inference under modern conditions that
the findings of science are not questioned on the whole.
The name of science is after all a word to conjure with.
So much so that the name and the mannerisms, at least,
if nothing more of science, have invaded all fields of
learning and have even overrun territory that belongs
to the enemy. So there are "sciences" of theology, law,
and medicine, as has already been noted above. And
there are such things as Christian Science, and "scientific"
astrology, palmistry, and the like. But within the field
of learning proper there is a similar predilection for an
air of scientific acumen and precision where science does
not belong. So that even that large range of knowledge
that has to do with general information rather than with
theory--what is loosely termed scholarship--tends
strongly to take on the name and forms of theoretical
statement. However decided the contrast between these
branches of knowledge on the one hand, and science properly
so called on the other hand, yet even the classical
learning, and the humanities generally, fall in with this
predilection more and more with each succeeding generation
of students. The students of literature, for instance,
are more and more prone to substitute critical
analysis and linguistic speculation, as the end of their endeavors,
in the place of that discipline of taste and that
cultivated sense of literary form and literary feeling that
-----File: 036.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
must always remain the chief end of literary training, as
distinct from philology and the social sciences. There
is, of course, no intention to question the legitimacy of a
science of philology or of the analytical study of literature
as a fact in cultural history, but these things do not
constitute training in literary taste, nor can they take
the place of it. The effect of this straining after scientific
formulations in a field alien to the scientific spirit
is as curious as it is wasteful. Scientifically speaking,
these quasi-scientific inquiries necessarily begin nowhere
and end in the same place; while in point of cultural gain
they commonly come to nothing better than spiritual abnegation.
But these blindfold endeavors to conform to
the canons of science serve to show how wide and unmitigated
the sway of science is in the modern community.

Scholarship--that is to say an intimate and systematic
familiarity with past cultural achievements--still holds
its place in the scheme of learning, in spite of the unadvised
efforts of the short-sighted to blend it with the work
of science, for it affords play for the ancient genial propensities
that ruled men's quest of knowledge before the
coming of science or of the outspoken pragmatic barbarism.
Its place may not be so large in proportion to
the entire field of learning as it was before the scientific
era got fully under way. But there is no intrinsic antagonism
between science and scholarship, as there is
between pragmatic training and scientific inquiry. Modern
scholarship shares with modern science the quality
of not being pragmatic in its aim. Like science it has no
ulterior end. It may be difficult here and there to draw
the line between science and scholarship, and it may even
more be unnecessary to draw such a line; yet while the
two ranges of discipline belong together in many ways,
and while there are many points of contact and sympathy
-----File: 037.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
between the two; while the two together make up the
modern scheme of learning; yet there is no need of confounding
the one with the other, nor can the one do the
work of the other. The scheme of learning has changed
in such manner as to give science the more commanding
place, but the scholar's domain has not thereby been invaded,
nor has it suffered contraction at the hands of
science, whatever may be said of the weak-kneed abnegation
of some whose place, if they have one, is in the
field of scholarship rather than of science.

<tb>

All that has been said above has of course nothing to
say as to the intrinsic merits of this quest of matter-of-fact
knowledge. In point of fact, science gives its tone
to modern culture. One may approve or one may deprecate
the fact that this opaque, materialistic interpretation
of things pervades modern thinking. That is a question
of taste, about which there is no disputing. The
prevalence of this matter-of-fact inquiry is a feature of
modern culture, and the attitude which critics take toward
this phenomenon is chiefly significant as indicating
how far their own habit of mind coincides with the enlightened
common-sense of civilised mankind. It shows
in what degree they are abreast of the advance of culture.
Those in whom the savage predilection or the barbarian
tradition is stronger than their habituation to civilised life
will find that this dominant factor of modern life is perverse,
if not calamitous; those whose habits of thought
have been fully shaped by the machine process and scientific
inquiry are likely to find it good. The modern
western culture, with its core of matter-of-fact knowledge,
may be better or worse than some other cultural
scheme, such as the classic Greek, the medi√¶val Christian,
the Hindu, or the Pueblo Indian. Seen in certain
-----File: 038.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
lights, tested by certain standards, it is doubtless better;
by other standards, worse. But the fact remains that
the current cultural scheme, in its maturest growth, is of
that complexion; its characteristic force lies in this matter-of-fact
insight; its highest discipline and its maturest
aspirations are these.

In point of fact, the sober common-sense of civilised
mankind accepts no other end of endeavor as self-sufficient
and ultimate. That such is the case seems to be
due chiefly to the ubiquitous presence of the machine
technology and its creations in the life of modern communities.
And so long as the machine process continues
to hold its dominant place as a disciplinary factor in modern
culture, so long must the spiritual and intellectual life
of this cultural era maintain the character which the
machine process gives it.

But while the scientist's spirit and his achievements stir
an unqualified admiration in modern men, and while his
discoveries carry conviction as nothing else does, it does
not follow that the manner of man which this quest of
knowledge produces or requires comes near answering to
the current ideal of manhood, or that his conclusions are
felt to be as good and beautiful as they are true. The
ideal man, and the ideal of human life, even in the apprehension
of those who most rejoice in the advances of
science, is neither the finikin skeptic in the laboratory
nor the animated slide-rule. The quest of science is
relatively new. It is a cultural factor not comprised, in
anything like its modern force, among those circumstances
whose selective action in the far past has given
to the race the human nature which it now has. The
race reached the human plane with little of this searching
knowledge of facts; and throughout the greater part
of its life-history on the human plane it has been accus-*
-----File: 039.png---\DPL\Tdslk\macaw89\alex cook\mle\---------------------
*tomed to make its higher generalisations and to formulate
its larger principles of life in other terms than those
of passionless matter-of-fact. This manner of knowledge
has occupied an increasing share of men's attention
in the past, since it bears in a decisive way upon the
minor affairs of workday life; but it has never until now
been put in the first place, as the dominant note of human
culture. The normal man, such as his inheritance has
made him, has therefore good cause to be restive under
its dominion.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC
POINT OF VIEW[1]


A discussion of the scientific point of view which avowedly
proceeds from this point of view itself has necessarily
the appearance of an argument in a circle; and such in
great part is the character of what here follows. It is
in large part an attempt to explain the scientific point of
view in terms of itself, but not altogether. This inquiry
does not presume to deal with the origin or the legitimation
of the postulates of science, but only with the growth
of the habitual use of these postulates, and the manner
of using them. The point of inquiry is the changes which
have taken place in the secondary postulates involved in
the scientific point of view--in great part a question of
the progressive redistribution of emphasis among the preconceptions
under whose guidance successive generations
of scientists have gone to their work.

<tb>

The sciences which are in any peculiar sense modern
take as an (unavowed) postulate the fact of consecutive
change. Their inquiry always centers upon some manner
of process. This notion of process about which the researches
of modern science cluster, is a notion of a sequence,
or complex, of consecutive change in which the
<i>nexus</i> of the sequence, that by virtue of which the change
inquired into is consecutive, is the relation of cause and
effect. The consecution, moreover, runs in terms of
persistence of quantity or of force. In so far as the sci-*

May 4, 1908. Reprinted by permission from the <i>University of
California Chronicle</i>, Vol. X, No. 4.]
-----File: 041.png---\Pitirim\Tdslk\maggiemeh\msmoose\mle\-----------------
*ence is of a modern complexion, in so far as it is not of
the nature of taxonomy simply, the inquiry converges
upon a matter of process; and it comes to rest, provisionally,
when it has disposed of its facts in terms of
process. But modern scientific inquiry in any case comes
to rest only provisionally; because its prime postulate is
that of consecutive change, and consecutive change can,
of course, not come to rest except provisionally. By its
own nature the inquiry cannot reach a final term in any
direction. So it is something of a homiletical common-*place
to say that the outcome of any serious research can
only be to make two questions grow where one question
grew before. Such is necessarily the case because the
postulate of the scientist is that things change consecutively.
It is an unproven and unprovable postulate--that
is to say, it is a metaphysical preconception--but it
gives the outcome that every goal of research is necessarily
a point of departure; every term is transitional.[2]

[Footnote 2: It is by no means unusual for modern scientists to deny the
truth of this characterization, so far as regards this alleged recourse
to the concept of causation. They deny that such a concept--of
efficiency, activity, and the like--enters, or can legitimately
enter, into their work, whether as an instrument of
research or as a means or guide to theoretical formulation. They
even deny the substantial continuity of the sequence of changes
that excite their scientific attention. This attitude seems particularly
to commend itself to those who by preference attend
to the mathematical formulations of theory and who are chiefly
occupied with proving up and working out details of the system
of theory which have previously been left unsettled or uncovered.
The concept of causation is recognized to be a metaphysical
postulate, a matter of imputation, not of observation; whereas
it is claimed that scientific inquiry neither does nor can legitimately,
nor, indeed, currently, make use of a postulate more metaphysical
than the concept of an idle concomitance of variation,
such as is adequately expressed in terms of mathematical
function.

The contention seems sound, to the extent that the materials--essentially
statistical materials--with which scientific inquiry]*

A hundred years ago, or even fifty years ago, scientific
men were not in the habit of looking at the matter

*[Footnote: is occupied are of this non-committal character, and that the
mathematical formulations of theory include no further element
than that of idle variation. Such is necessarily the case because
causation is a fact of imputation, not of observation, and so cannot
be included among the data; and because nothing further
than non-committal variation can be expressed in mathematical
terms. A bare notation of quantity can convey nothing further.

If it were the intention to claim only that the conclusions of
the scientists are, or should be, as a matter of conservative caution,
overtly stated in terms of function alone, then the contention
might well be allowed. Causal sequence, efficiency or
continuity is, of course, a matter of metaphysical imputation.
It is not a fact of observation, and cannot be asserted of the
facts of observation except as a trait imputed to them. It is so
imputed, by scientists and others, as a matter of logical necessity,
as a basis of a systematic knowledge of the facts of observation.

Beyond this, in their exercise of scientific initiative, as well as
in the norms which guide the systematisation of scientific results,
the contention will not be made good--at least not for the current
phase of scientific knowledge. The claim, indeed, carries
its own refutation. In making such a claim, both in rejecting
the imputation of metaphysical postulates and in defending their
position against their critics, the arguments put forward by the
scientists run in causal terms. For the polemical purposes,
where their antagonists are to be scientifically confuted, the
defenders of the non-committal postulate of concomitance find
that postulate inadequate. They are not content, in this precarious
conjuncture, simply to attest a relation of idle quantitative
concomitance (mathematical function) between the allegations
of their critics, on the one hand, and their own controversial
exposition of these matters on the other hand. They
argue that they do not "make use of" such a postulate as "efficiency,"
whereas they claim to "make use of" the concept of
function. But "make use of" is not a notion of functional variation
but of causal efficiency in a somewhat gross and highly
anthropomorphic form. The relation between their own thinking
and the "principles" which they "apply" or the experiments and
calculations which they "institute" in their "search" for facts,
is not held to be of this non-committal kind. It will not be
claimed that the shrewd insight and the bold initiative of a man
eminent in the empirical sciences bear no more efficient or con-*]*
-----File: 043.png---\Pitirim\Lithui\maggiemeh\thorgon\mle\----------------
in this way. At least it did not then seem a matter of
course, lying in the nature of things, that scientific inquiry

*[Footnote: *sequential a relation than that of mathematical function to the
ingenious experiments by which he tests his hypotheses and extends
the secure bounds of human knowledge. Least of all is the
masterly experimentalist himself in a position to deny that his
intelligence counts for something more efficient than idle concomitance
in such a case. The connection between his premises,
hypotheses, and experiments, on the one hand, and his theoretical
results, on the other hand, is not felt to be of the nature
of mathematical function. Consistently adhered to, the principle
of "function" or concomitant variation precludes recourse
to experiment, hypotheses or inquiry--indeed, it precludes "recourse"
to anything whatever. Its notation does not comprise
anything so anthropomorphic.

The case is illustrated by the latter-day history of theoretical
physics. Of the sciences which affect a non-committal attitude
in respect of the concept of efficiency and which claim to get
along with the notion of mathematical function alone, physics
is the most outspoken and the one in which the claim has the
best <i>prima facie</i> validity. At the same time, latter-day physicists,
for a hundred years or more, have been much occupied with
explaining how phenomena which to all appearance involve action
at a distance do not involve action at a distance at all. The
greater theoretical achievements of physics during the past century
lie within the sweep of this (metaphysical) principle that
action at a distance does not take place, that apparent action
at a distance must be explained by effective contact, through a
continuum, or by a material transference. But this principle is
nothing better than an unreasoning repugnance on the part of the
physicists to admitting action at a distance. The requirement of
a continuum involves a gross form of the concept of efficient
causation. The "functional" concept, concomitant variation, requires
no contact and no continuum. Concomitance at a distance
is quite as simple and convincing a notion as concomitance
within contact or by the intervention of a continuum, if not more
so. What stands in the way of its acceptance is the irrepressible
anthropomorphism of the physicists. And yet the great
achievements of physics are due to the initiative of men animated
with this anthropomorphic repugnance to the notion of concomitant
variation at a distance. All the generalisations on undulatory
motion and translation belong here. The latter-day
researches in light, electrical transmission, the theory of ions,
together with what is known of the obscure and late-found]*

could not reach a final term in any direction. To-day it
is a matter of course, and will be so avowed without argument.
Stated in the broadest terms, this is the substantial
outcome of that nineteenth-century movement in science
with which the name of Darwin is associated as a
catch-word.

This use of Darwin's name does not imply that this
epoch of science is mainly Darwin's work. What merit
may belong to Darwin, specifically, in these premises, is a
question which need not detain the argument. He may,
by way of creative initiative, have had more or less to do
with shaping the course of things scientific. Or, if you
choose, his voice may even be taken as only one of the
noises which the wheels of civilisation make when they
go round. But by scientifically colloquial usage we have
come to speak of pre-Darwinian and post-Darwinian science,
and to appreciate that there is a significant difference
in the point of view between the scientific era which
preceded and that which followed the epoch to which his
name belongs.

Before that epoch the animus of a science was, on the
whole, the animus of taxonomy; the consistent end of
scientific inquiry was definition and classification,--as
it still continues to be in such fields of science as have
not been affected by the modern notion of consecutive
change. The scientists of that era looked to a final term,
a consummation of the changes which provoked their inquiry,
as well as to a first beginning of the matters with
which their researches were concerned. The questions
of science were directed to the problem, essentially classi-*

*[Footnote: radiations and emanations, are to be credited to the same metaphysical
preconception, which is never absent in any "scientific"
inquiry in the field of physical science. It is only the "occult"
and "Christian" "Sciences" that can dispense with this metaphysical
postulate and take recourse to "absent treatment."]

*ficatory, of how things had been in the presumed primordial
stable equilibrium out of which they, putatively,
had come, and how they should be in the definitive state
of settlement into which things were to fall as the outcome
of the play of forces which intervened between
this primordial and the definitive stable equilibrium. To
the pre-Darwinian taxonomists the center of interest and
attention, to which all scientific inquiry must legitimately
converge, was the body of natural laws governing phenomena
under the rule of causation. These natural laws
were of the nature of rules of the game of causation.
They formulated the immutable relations in which things
"naturally" stood to one another before causal disturbance
took place between them, the orderly unfolding of
the complement of causes involved in the transition over
this interval of transient activity, and the settled relations
that would supervene when the disturbance had passed
and the transition from cause to effect had been consummated,--the
emphasis falling on the consummation.

The characteristic feature by which post-Darwinian
science is contrasted with what went before is a new distribution
of emphasis, whereby the process of causation,
the interval of instability and transition between initial
cause and definitive effect, has come to take the first place
in the inquiry; instead of that consummation in which
causal effect was once presumed to come to rest. This
change of the point of view was, of course, not abrupt
or catastrophic. But it has latterly gone so far that modern
science is becoming substantially a theory of the process
of consecutive change, which is taken as a sequence
of cumulative change, realized to be self-continuing or
self-propagating and to have no final term. Questions
of a primordial beginning and a definitive outcome have
fallen into abeyance within the modern sciences, and
-----File: 046.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
such questions are in a fair way to lose all claim to consideration
at the hands of the scientists. Modern science
is ceasing to occupy itself with the natural laws--the
codified rules of the game of causation--and is concerning
itself wholly with what has taken place and what
is taking place.

<tb>

Rightly seen from this ultra-modern point of view,
this modern science and this point of view which it affects
are, of course, a feature of the current cultural situation,--of
the process of life as it runs along under our eyes.
So also, when seen from this scientific point of view, it
is a matter of course that any marked cultural era will
have its own characteristic attitude and animus toward
matters of knowledge, will bring under inquiry such
questions of knowledge as lie within its peculiar range
of interest, and will seek answers to these questions only
in terms that are consonant with the habits of thought
current at the time. That is to say, science and the scientific
point of view will vary characteristically in response
to those variations in the prevalent habits of
thought which constitute the sequence of cultural development;
the current science and the current scientific point
of view, the knowledge sought and the manner of seeking
it, are a product of the cultural growth. Perhaps
it would all be better characterised as a by-product of
the cultured growth.

<tb>

This question of a scientific point of view, of a particular
attitude and animus in matters of knowledge, is a
question of the formation of habits of thought; and habits
of thought are an outcome of habits of life. A scientific
point of view is a consensus of habits of thought
current in the community, and the scientist is constrained
-----File: 047.png---\Pitirim\basophil\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
to believe that this consensus is formed in response to a
more or less consistent discipline of habituation to which
the community is subjected, and that the consensus can
extend only so far and maintain its force only so long
as the discipline of habituation exercised by the circumstances
of life enforces it and backs it up. The scheme
of life, within which lies the scheme of knowledge, is a
consensus of habits in the individuals which make up the
community. The individual subjected to habituation is
each a single individual agent, and whatever affects him
in any one line of activity, therefore, necessarily affects
him in some degree in all his various activities. The cultural
scheme of any community is a complex of the habits
of life and of thought prevalent among the members of
the community. It makes up a more or less congruous
and balanced whole, and carries within it a more or less
consistent habitual attitude toward matters of knowledge--more
or less consistent according as the community's
cultural scheme is more or less congruous through-*out
the body of the population; and this in its turn is in
the main a question of how nearly uniform or consonant
are the circumstances of experience and tradition to
which the several classes and members of the community
are subject.

So, then, the change which has come over the scientific
point of view between pre-Darwinian and post-Darwinian
times is to be explained, at least in great part, by the
changing circumstances of life, and therefore of habituation,
among the people of Christendom during the life-*history
of modern science. But the growth of a scientific
point of view begins farther back than modern Christendom,
and a record of its growth would be a record of the
growth of human culture. Modern science demands a
genetic account of the phenomena with which it deals,
-----File: 048.png---\Pitirim\skovalchik\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
and a genetic inquiry into the scientific point of view
necessarily will have to make up its account with the
earlier phases of cultural growth. A life-history of human
culture is a large topic, not to be attempted here even
in the sketchiest outline. The most that can be attempted
is a hasty review of certain scattered questions and salient
points in this life-history.

<tb>

In what manner and with what effect the idle curiosity
of mankind first began to tame the facts thrown in its
way, far back in the night of time, and to break them in
under a scheme of habitual interpretation; what may have
been the earliest norms of systematic knowledge, such
as would serve the curiosity of the earliest generations
of men in a way analogous to the service rendered the
curiosity of later generations by scientific inquiry--all
that is, of course, a matter of long-range conjecture, more
or less wild, which cannot be gone into here. But among
such peoples of the lower cultures as have been consistently
observed, norms of knowledge and schemes for
its systematization are always found. These norms and
systems of knowledge are na√Øve and crude, perhaps, but
there is fair ground for presuming that out of the like
norms and systems in the remoter ages of our own antecedents
have grown up the systems of knowledge cultivated
by the peoples of history and by their representatives
now living.

It is not unusual to say that the primitive systems of
knowledge are constructed on animistic lines; that animistic
sequence is the rule to which the facts are broken
in. This seems to be true, if "animism" be construed
in a sufficiently na√Øve and inchoate[** typo in original - should read 'incohate' ** Sorry - just looked it up - 'inchoate' is correct.] sense. But this is not
the whole case. In their higher generalisations, in what
Powell calls their "sophiology," it appears that the prim-*
-----File: 049.png---\Pitirim\skovalchik\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*itive peoples are guided by animistic norms; they make up
their cosmological schemes, and the like, in terms of
personal or quasi-personal activity, and the whole is
thrown into something of a dramatic form. Through the
early cosmological lore runs a dramatic consistency which
imputes something in the way of initiative and propensity
to the phenomena that are to be accounted for. But this
dramatisation of the facts, the accounting for phenomena
in terms of spiritual or quasi-spiritual initiative, is by no
means the whole case of primitive men's systematic knowledge
of facts. Their theories are not all of the nature of
dramatic legend, myth, or animistic life-history, although
the broader and more picturesque generalisations may
take that form. There always runs along by the side of
these dramaturgic life-histories, and underlying them, an
obscure system of generalisations in terms of matter-of-fact.
The system of matter-of-fact generalisations, or
theories, is obscurer than the dramatic generalisations only
in the sense that it is left in the background as being less
picturesque and of less vital interest, not in the sense of
being less familiar, less adequately apprehended, or less
secure. The peoples of the lower cultures "know" that
the broad scheme of things is to be explained in terms of
creation, perhaps of procreation, gestation, birth, growth,
life and initiative; and these matters engross the attention
and stimulate speculation. But they know equally
well the matter of fact that water will run down hill,
that two stones are heavier than one of them, that an
edge-tool will cut softer substances, that two things may
be tied together with a string, that a pointed stick may
be stuck in the ground, and the like. There is no range
of knowledge that is held more securely by any people
than such matters of fact; and these are generalisations
from experience; they are theoretical knowledge, and they
-----File: 050.png---\Pitirim\skovalchik\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
are a matter of course. They underlie the dramatical
generalisations of the broad scheme of things, and are
so employed in the speculations of the myth-makers and
the learned.

It may be that the exceptional efficiency of a given
edge-tool, <i>e.g.</i>, will be accounted for on animistic or
quasi-personal grounds,--grounds of magical efficacy;
but it is the exceptional behavior of such a tool that calls
for explanation on the higher ground of animistic potency,
not its work-day performance of common work.
So also if an edge-tool should fail to do what is expected
of it as a matter of course, its failure may require an
explanation in other terms than matter-of-fact. But all
that only serves to bring into evidence the fact that a
scheme of generalisations in terms of matter-of-fact is
securely held and is made use of as a sufficient and ultimate
explanation of the more familiar phenomena of experience.
These commonplace matter-of-fact generalisations
are not questioned and do not clash with the higher
scheme of things.

All this may seem like taking pains about trivialities.
But the data with which any scientific inquiry has to do
are trivialities in some other bearing than that one in
which they are of account.

In all succeeding phases of culture, developmentally
subsequent to the primitive phase supposed above, there
is found a similar or analogous division of knowledge
between a higher range of theoretical explanations of
phenomena, an ornate scheme of things, on the one hand,
and such an obscure range of matter-of-fact generalisations
as is here spoken of, on the other hand. And the
evolution of the scientific point of view is a matter of the
shifting fortunes which have in the course of cultural
growth overtaken the one and the other of these two
-----File: 051.png---\Pitirim\dturkheimer\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
divergent methods of apprehending and systematising the
facts of experience.

The historians of human culture have, no doubt justly,
commonly dealt with the mutations that have occurred on
the higher levels of intellectual enterprise, in the more
ambitious, more picturesque, and less secure of these two
contrasted ranges of theoretical knowledge; while the
lower range of generalisations, which has to do with
work-day experience, has in great part been passed over
with scant ceremony as lying outside the current of ideas,
and as belonging rather among the things which engage
the attention than among the modes, expedients and creations
of this attention itself. There is good reason for
this relative neglect of the work-day matters of fact. It
is on the higher levels of speculative generalisation that
the impressive mutations in the development of thought
have taken place, and that the shifting of points of view
and the clashing of convictions have drawn men into controversy
and analysis of their ideas and have given rise
to schools of thought. The matter-of-fact generalisations
have met with relatively few adventures and have afforded
little scope for intellectual initiative and profoundly picturesque
speculation. On the higher levels speculation is
freer, the creative spirit has some scope, because its excursions
are not so immediately and harshly checked by
material facts.

In these speculative ranges of knowledge it is possible
to form and to maintain habits of thought which shall be
consistent with themselves and with the habit of mind and
run of tradition prevalent in the community at the time,
though not thereby consistent with the material actualities
of life in the community. Yet this range of speculative
generalisation, which makes up the higher learning
of the barbarian culture, is also controlled, checked, and
-----File: 052.png---\DPL\dturkheimer\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
guided by the community's habits of life; it, too, is an
integral part of the scheme of life and is an outcome of
the habituation enforced by experience. But it does not
rest immediately on men's dealings with the refractory
phenomena of brute creation, nor is it guided, undisguised
and directly, by the habitual material (industrial) occupations.
The fabric of institutions intervenes between
the material exigencies of life and the speculative scheme
of things.

The higher theoretical knowledge, that body of tenets
which rises to the dignity of a philosophical or scientific
system, in the early culture, is a complex of habits of
thought which reflect the habits of life embodied in the
institutional structure of society; while the lower, matter-of-fact
generalisations of work-day efficiency--the trivial
matters of course--reflect the workmanlike habits of
life enforced by the commonplace material exigencies under
which men live. The distinction is analogous, and
indeed, closely related, to the distinction between "intangible"
and "tangible" assets. And the institutions
are more flexible, they involve or admit a larger margin
of error, or of tolerance, than the material exigencies.
The latter are systematised into what economists have
called "the state of the **idustrial** arts," which enforce
a somewhat rigorous standardisation of whatever knowledge
falls within their scope; whereas the institutional
scheme is a matter of law and custom, politics and religion,
taste and morals, on all of which matters men have
opinions and convictions, and on which all men "have a
right to their own opinions." The scheme of institutions
is also not necessarily uniform throughout the several
classes of society; and the same institution (as, <i>e.g.</i>,
slavery, ownership, or royalty) does not impinge with the
same effect on all parties touched by it. The discipline of
-----File: 053.png---\Pitirim\dturkheimer\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
any institution of servitude, <i>e.g.</i>, is not the same for the
master as for the serf, etc. If there is a considerable
institutional discrepancy between an upper and a lower
class in the community, leading to divergent lines of
habitual interest or discipline; if by force of the cultural
scheme the institutions of society are chiefly in the keeping
of one class, whose attention is then largely engrossed
with the maintenance of the scheme of law and order;
while the workmanlike activities are chiefly in the hands
of another class, in whose apprehension the maintenance
of law and order is at the best a wearisome tribulation,
there is likely to be a similarly considerable divergence
or discrepancy between the speculative knowledge, cultivated
primarily by the upper class, and the work-day
knowledge which is primarily in the keeping of the lower
class. Such, in particular, will be the case if the community
is organised on a coercive plan, with well-marked
ruling and subject classes. The important and interesting
institutions in such a case, those institutions which
fill a large angle in men's vision and carry a great force
of authenticity, are the institutions of coercive control,
differential authority and subjection, personal dignity and
consequence; and the speculative generalisations, the institutions
of the realm of knowledge, are created in
the image of these social institutions of status and personal
force, and fall into a scheme drawn after the plan
of the code of honor. The work-day generalisations,
which emerge from the state of the industrial arts, concomitantly
fall into a deeper obscurity, answering to the
depth of indignity to which workmanlike efficiency sinks
under such a cultural scheme; and they can touch and
check the current speculative knowledge only remotely
and incidentally. Under such a bifurcate scheme of culture,
with its concomitant two-cleft systematisation of
-----File: 054.png---\DPL\dturkheimer\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
knowledge, "reality" is likely to be widely dissociated
from fact--that is to say, the realities and verities which
are accepted as authentic and convincing on the plane of
speculative generalisation; while science has no show--that
is to say, science in that modern sense of the term
which implies a close contact, if not a coincidence, of
reality with fact.

Whereas, if the institutional fabric, the community's
scheme of life, changes in such a manner as to throw the
work-day experience into the foreground of attention and
to center the habitual interest of the people on the immediate
material relations of men to the brute actualities,
then the interval between the speculative realm of knowledge,
on the one hand, and the work-day generalisations
of fact, on the other hand, is likely to lessen, and the two
ranges of knowledge are likely to converge more or less
effectually upon a common ground. When the growth of
culture falls into such lines, these two methods and norms
of theoretical formulation may presently come to further
and fortify one another, and something in the way of
science has at least a chance to arise.

<tb>

On this view there is a degree of interdependence between
the cultural situation and the state of theoretical
inquiry. To illustrate this interdependence, or the concomitance
between the cultural scheme and the character
of theoretical speculation, it may be in place to call to
mind certain concomitant variations of a general character
which occur in the lower cultures between the
scheme of life and the scheme of knowledge. In this
tentative and fragmentary presentation of evidence there
is nothing novel to be brought forward; still less is there
anything to be offered which carries the weight of authority.
-----File: 055.png---\Pitirim\basophil\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------

On the lower levels of culture, even more decidedly than
on the higher, the speculative systematisation of knowledge
is prone to take the form of theology (mythology)
and cosmology. This theological and cosmological lore
serves the savage and barbaric peoples as a theoretical
account of the scheme of things, and its characteristic
traits vary in response to the variations of the institutional
scheme under which the community lives. In a
prevailingly peaceable agricultural community, such, <i>e.g.</i>,
as the more peaceable Pueblo Indians or the more settled
Indians of the Middle West, there is little coercive authority,
few and slight class distinctions involving superiority
and inferiority; property rights are few, slight
and unstable; relationship is likely to be counted in the
female line. In such a culture the cosmological lore is
likely to offer explanations of the scheme of things in
terms of generation or germination and growth. Creation
by fiat is not obtrusively or characteristically present.
The laws of nature bear the character of an habitual
behavior of things, rather than that of an authoritative
code of ordinances imposed by an overruling providence.
The theology is likely to be polytheistic in an extreme degree
and in an extremely loose sense of the term, embodying
relatively little of the suzerainty of God. The relation
of the deities to mankind is likely to be that of consanguinity,
and as if to emphasise the peaceable, non-*coercive
character of the divine order of things, the deities
are, in the main, very apt to be females. The matters of
interest dealt with in the cosmological theories are chiefly
matters of the livelihood of the people, the growth and
care of the crops, and the promotion of industrial ways
and means.

With these phenomena of the peaceable culture may be
contrasted the order of things found among a predatory
-----File: 056.png---\Pitirim\elizracz\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
pastoral people--and pastoral peoples tend strongly to
take on a predatory cultural scheme. Such a people will
adopt male deities, in the main, and will impute to them a
coercive, imperious, arbitrary animus and a degree of
princely dignity. They will also tend strongly to a monotheistic,
patriarchal scheme of divine government; to explain
things in terms of creative fiat; and to a belief in
the control of the natural universe by rules imposed by
divine ordinance. The matters of prime consequence in
this theology are matters of the servile relation of man
to God, rather than the details of the quest of a livelihood.
The emphasis falls on the glory of God rather than on
the good of man. The Hebrew scriptures, particularly
the Jahvistic elements, show such a scheme of pastoral
cultural and predatory theoretical generalisations.

The learning cultivated on the lower levels of culture
might be gone into at some length if space and time permitted,
but even what has been said may serve to show,
in the most general way, what are the characteristic marks
of this savage and barbarian lore. A similarly summary
characterisation of a cultural situation nearer home will
bear more directly on the immediate topic of inquiry.
The learning of medi√¶val Christendom shows such a concomitance
between the scheme of knowledge and the
scheme of institutions, somewhat analogous to the barbaric
Hebrew situation. The medi√¶val scheme of institutions
was of a coercive, authoritative character, essentially
a scheme of graded mastery and graded servitude,
in which a code of honor and a bill of differential dignity
held the most important place. The theology of that
time was of a like character. It was a monotheistic, or
rather a monarchical system, and of a despotic complexion.
The cosmological scheme was drawn in terms
of fiat; and the natural philosophy was occupied, in the
-----File: 057.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
main and in its most solemn endeavors, with the corollaries
to be subsumed under the divine fiat. When the
philosophical speculation dealt with facts it aimed to
interpret them into systematic consistency with the glory
of God and the divine purpose. The "realities" of the
scholastic lore were spiritual, quasi-personal, intangible,
and fell into a scale of differential dignity and prepotency.
Matter-of-fact knowledge and work-day information were
not then fit topics of dignified inquiry. The interval, or
discrepancy, between reality and actuality was fairly wide.
Throughout that era, of course, work-day knowledge also
continually increased in volume and consistency; technological
proficiency was gaining; the effective control
of natural processes was growing larger and more secure;
showing that matter-of-fact theories drawn from experience
were being extended and were made increasing
use of. But all this went on in the field of industry; the
matter-of-fact theories were accepted as substantial and
ultimate only for the purposes of industry, only as technological
maxims, and were beneath the dignity of science.

With the transition to modern times industry comes into
the foreground in the west-European scheme of life, and
the institutions of European civilisation fall into a more
intimate relation with the exigencies of industry and
technology. The technological range of habituation progressively
counts for more in the cultural complex, and
the discrepancy between the technological discipline and
the discipline of law and order under the institutions then
in force grows progressively less. The institutions of law
and order take on a more impersonal, less coercive character.
Differential dignity and invidious discriminations
between classes gradually lose force.

The industry which so comes into the foreground and
so affects the scheme of institutions is peculiar in that its
-----File: 058.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
most obvious and characteristic trait is the workmanlike
initiative and efficiency of the individual handicraftsman
and the individual enterprise of the petty trader. The
technology which embodies the theoretical substance of
this industry is a technology of workmanship, in which
the salient factors are personal skill, force and diligence.
Such a technology, running as it does in great
part on personal initiative, capacity, and application,
approaches nearer to the commonplace features of the
institutional fabric than many another technological system
might; and its disciplinary effects in some considerable
measure blend with those of the institutional discipline.
The two lines of habituation, in the great era of
handicraft and petty trade, even came to coalesce and
fortify one another; as in the organisation of the craft
gilds and of the industrial towns. Industrial life and
usage came to intrude creatively into the cultural scheme
on the one hand and into the scheme of authentic knowledge
on the other hand. So the body of matter-of-fact
knowledge, in modern times, is more and more drawn
into the compass of theoretical inquiry; and theoretical
inquiry takes on more and more of the animus and
method of technological generalisation. But the matter-of-fact
elements so drawn in are construed in terms of
workmanlike initiative and efficiency, as required by the
technological preconceptions of the era of handicraft.

In this way, it may be conceived, modern science comes
into the field under the cloak of technology and gradually
encroaches on the domain of authentic theory previously
held by other, higher, nobler, more profound, more spiritual,
more intangible conceptions and systems of knowledge.
In this early phase of modern science its central
norm and universal solvent is the concept of workmanlike
initiative and efficiency. This is the new organon.
-----File: 059.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
Whatever is to be explained must be reduced to this
notation and explained in these terms; otherwise the inquiry
does not come to rest. But when the requirements
of this notation in terms of workmanship have been duly
fulfilled the inquiry does come to rest.

By the early decades of the nineteenth century, with a
passable degree of thoroughness, other grounds of validity
and other interpretations of phenomena, other vouchers
for truth and reality, had been eliminated from the quest
of authentic knowledge and from the terms in which
theoretical results were conceived or expressed. The
new organon had made good its pretensions. In this
movement to establish the hegemony of workmanlike efficiency--under
the style and title of the "law of causation,"
or of "efficient cause"--in the realm of knowledge,
the English-speaking communities took the lead after
the earlier scientific onset of the south-European communities
had gone up in the smoke of war, politics and
religion during the great era of state-making. The
ground of this British lead in science is apparently the
same as that of the British lead in technology which came
to a head in the Industrial Revolution; and these two
associated episodes of European civilisation are apparently
both traceable to the relatively peaceable run of
life, and so of habituation, in the English-speaking communities,
as contrasted with the communities of the continent.[3]

Along with the habits of thought peculiar to the tech-*

[Footnote 3: A broad exception may perhaps be taken at this point, to the
effect that this sketch of the growth of the scientific animus
overlooks the science of the Ancients. The scientific achievements
of classical antiquity are a less obscure topic to-day than
ever before during modern times, and the more there is known
of them the larger is the credit given them. But it is to be noted
that, (<i>a</i>) the relatively large and free growth of scientific in-*]*

*nology of handicraft, modern science also took over and
assimilated much of the institutional preconceptions of
the era of handicraft and petty trade. The "natural
laws," with the formulation of which this early modern
science is occupied, are the rules governing natural "uniformities
of sequence"; and they punctiliously formulate
the due procedure of any given cause creatively working
out the achievement of a given effect, very much as the
craft rules sagaciously specified the due routine for turning
out a staple article of merchantable goods. But these
"natural laws" of science are also felt to have something
of that integrity and prescriptive moral force that
belongs to the principles of the system of "natural
rights" which the era of handicraft has contributed to
the institutional scheme of later times. The natural laws
were not only held to be true to fact, but they were also

*[Footnote: *quiry in classical antiquity is to be found in the relatively peaceable
and industrial Greek communities (with an industrial culture
of unknown pre-Hellenic antiquity), and (<i>b</i>) that the sciences
best and chiefly cultivated were those which rest on a mathematical
basis, if not mathematical sciences in the simpler sense
of the term. Now, mathematics occupies a singular place among
the sciences, in that it is, in its pure form, a logical discipline
simply; its subject matter being the logic of quantity, and its
researches being of the nature of an analysis of the intellect's
modes of dealing with matters of quantity. Its generalisations
are generalisations of logical procedure, which are tested and
verified by immediate self-observation. Such a science is in a
peculiar degree, but only in a peculiar degree, independent of the
detail-discipline of daily life, whether technological or institutional;
and, given the propensity--the intellectual enterprise,
or "idle curiosity"--to go into speculation in such a field, the
results can scarcely vary in a manner to make the variants inconsistent
among themselves; nor need the state of institutions
or the state of the industrial arts seriously color or distort such
analytical work in such a field. Mathematics is peculiarly independent
of cultural circumstances, since it deals analytically with
mankind's native gifts of logic, not with the ephemeral traits acquired
by habituation.]
-----File: 061.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
felt to be right and good. They were looked upon as
intrinsically meritorious and beneficent, and were held
to carry a sanction of their own. This habit of uncritically
imputing merit and equity to the "natural laws"
of science continued in force through much of the nineteenth
century; very much as the habitual acceptance of
the principles of "natural rights" has held on by force
of tradition long after the exigencies of experience out
of which these "rights" sprang ceased to shape men's
habits of life.[4] This traditional attitude of submissive
approval toward the "natural laws" of science has not
yet been wholly lost, even among the scientists of the
passing generation, many of whom have uncritically invested
these "laws" with a prescriptive rectitude and
excellence; but so far, at least, has this animus progressed
toward disuse that it is now chiefly a matter for expatiation
in the pulpit, the accredited vent for the exudation
of effete matter from the cultural organism.

The traditions of the handicraft technology lasted over
as a commonplace habit of thought in science long after
that technology had ceased to be the decisive element in
the industrial situation; while a new technology, with its
inculcation of new habits of thought, new preconceptions,
gradually made its way among the remnants of the
old, altering them, blending with them, and little by little

[Footnote 4: "Natural laws," which are held to be not only correct
formulations of the sequence of cause and effect in a given
situation but also meritoriously right and equitable rules governing
the run of events, necessarily impute to the facts and
events in question a tendency to a good and equitable, if not
beneficent, consummation; since it is necessarily the consummation,
the effect considered as an accomplished outcome, that is to
be adjudged good and equitable, if anything. Hence these
"natural laws," as traditionally conceived, are laws governing
the accomplishment of an end--that is to say, laws as to how a
sequence of cause and effect comes to rest in a final term.]
-----File: 062.png---\Pitirim\AmberK\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
superseding them. The new technological departure,
which made its first great epoch in the so-called industrial
revolution, in the technological ascendancy of the machine-process,
brought a new and characteristic discipline
into the cultural situation. The beginnings of the machine-era
lie far back, no doubt; but it is only of late,
during the past century at the most, that the machine-process
can be said to have come into the dominant place
in the technological scheme; and it is only later still that
its discipline has, even in great part, remodeled the current
preconceptions as to the substantial nature of what
goes on in the current of phenomena whose changes excite
the scientific curiosity. It is only relatively very
lately, whether in technological work or in scientific inquiry,
that men have fallen into the habit of thinking
in terms of process rather than in terms of the workmanlike
efficiency of a given cause working to a given effect.

These machine-made preconceptions of modern science,
being habits of thought induced by the machine technology
in industry and in daily life, have of course first
and most consistently affected the character of those sciences
whose subject matter lies nearest to the technological
field of the machine-process; and in these material
sciences the shifting to the machine-made point of view
has been relatively very consistent, giving a highly impersonal
interpretation of phenomena in terms of consecutive
change, and leaving little of the ancient preconceptions
of differential reality or creative causation. In
such a science as physics or chemistry, <i>e.g.</i>, we are threatened
with the disappearance or dissipation of all stable
and efficient substances; their place being supplied, or
their phenomena being theoretically explained, by appeal
to unremitting processes of inconceivably high-pitched
consecutive change.
-----File: 063.png---\Pitirim\AmberK\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------

In the sciences which lie farther afield from the technological
domain, and which, therefore, in point of habituation,
are remoter from the center of disturbance, the
effect of the machine discipline may even yet be scarcely
appreciable. In such lore as ethics, <i>e.g.</i>, or political
theory, or even economics, much of the norms of the
r√©gime of handicraft still stands over; and very much
of the institutional preconceptions of natural rights, associated
with the r√©gime of handicraft in point of genesis,
growth and content, is not only still intact in this field of
inquiry, but it can scarcely even be claimed that there is
ground for serious apprehension of its prospective obsolescence.
Indeed, something even more ancient than
handicraft and natural rights may be found surviving
in good vigor in this "moral" field of inquiry, where
tests of authenticity and reality are still sought and found
by those who cultivate these lines of inquiry that lie beyond
the immediate sweep of the machine's discipline.
Even the evolutionary process of cumulative causation
as conceived by the adepts of these sciences is infused
with a preternatural, beneficent trend; so that "evolution"
is conceived to mean amelioration or "improvement."
The metaphysics of the machine technology has
not yet wholly, perhaps not mainly, superseded the metaphysics
of the code of honor in those lines of inquiry
that have to do with human initiative and aspiration.
Whether such a shifting of the point of view in these
sciences shall ever be effected is still an open question.
Here there still are spiritual verities which transcend the
sweep of consecutive change. That is to say, there are
still current habits of thought which definitively predispose
their bearers to bring their inquiries to rest on
grounds of differential reality and invidious merit.

WHY IS ECONOMICS NOT AN EVOLUTIONARY
SCIENCE?[1]


M. G. De Lapouge recently said, "Anthropology is destined
to revolutionise the political and the social sciences
as radically as bacteriology has revolutionised the science
of medicine."[2] In so far as he speaks of economics, the
eminent anthropologist is not alone in his conviction that
the science stands in need of rehabilitation. His words
convey a rebuke and an admonition, and in both respects
he speaks the sense of many scientists in his own and
related lines of inquiry. It may be taken as the consensus
of those men who are doing the serious work of modern
anthropology, ethnology, and psychology, as well as of
those in the biological sciences proper, that economics is
helplessly behind the times, and unable to handle its subject-matter
in a way to entitle it to standing as a modern
science. The other political and social sciences come in
for their share of this obloquy, and perhaps on equally
cogent grounds. Nor are the economists themselves
buoyantly indifferent to the rebuke. Probably no economist
to-day has either the hardihood or the inclination to
say that the science has now reached a definitive formulation,
either in the detail of results or as regards the fundamental
features of theory. The nearest recent approach
to such a position on the part of an economist of

Economics</i>, vol. xii, July, 1898.]

[Footnote 2: "The Fundamental Laws of Anthropo-sociology," <i>Journal
of Political Economy</i>, December, 1897, p. 54. The same paper,
in substance, appears in the <i>Rivista Italiana di Sociologia</i> for
November, 1897.]
-----File: 065.png---\Pitirim\AmberK\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
accredited standing is perhaps to be found in Professor
Marshall's Cambridge address of a year and a half ago.[3]
But these utterances are so far from the jaunty confidence
shown by the classical economists of half a century ago
that what most forcibly strikes the reader of Professor
Marshall's address is the exceeding modesty and the uncalled-for
humility of the spokesman for the "old generation."
With the economists who are most attentively
looked to for guidance, uncertainty as to the definitive
value of what has been and is being done, and as to what
we may, with effect, take to next, is so common as to
suggest that indecision is a meritorious work. Even the
Historical School, who made their innovation with so
much home-grown applause some time back, have been
unable to settle down contentedly to the pace which they
set themselves.

The men of the sciences that are proud to own themselves
"modern" find fault with the economists for being
still content to occupy themselves with repairing a structure
and doctrines and maxims resting on natural rights,
utilitarianism, and administrative expediency. This aspersion
is not altogether merited, but is near enough to the
mark to carry a sting. These modern sciences are evolutionary
sciences, and their adepts contemplate that characteristic
of their work with some complacency. Economics
is not an evolutionary science--by the confession of its
spokesmen; and the economists turn their eyes with something
of envy and some sense of baffled emulation to these
rivals that make broad their phylacteries with the legend,
"Up to date."

Precisely wherein the social and political sciences, including
economics, fall short of being evolutionary sci-*

[Footnote 3: "The Old Generation of Economists and the New," <i>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, January, 1897, p. 133.]
-----File: 066.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
*ences, is not so plain. At least, it has not been satisfactorily
pointed out by their critics. Their successful rivals
in this matter--the sciences that deal with human nature
among the rest--claim as their substantial distinction
that they are realistic: they deal with facts. But economics,
too, is realistic in this sense: it deals with facts,
often in the most painstaking way, and latterly with an
increasingly strenuous insistence on the sole efficacy of
data. But this "realism" does not make economics an
evolutionary science. The insistence on data could
scarcely be carried to a higher pitch than it was carried
by the first generation of the Historical School; and yet
no economics is farther from being an evolutionary science
than the received economics of the Historical School.
The whole broad range of erudition and research that
engaged the energies of that school commonly falls short
of being science, in that, when consistent, they have contented
themselves with an enumeration of data and a
narrative account of industrial development, and have not
presumed to offer a theory of anything or to elaborate
their results into a consistent body of knowledge.

Any evolutionary science, on the other hand, is a close-knit
body of theory. It is a theory of a process, of an
unfolding sequence. But here, again, economics seems to
meet the test in a fair measure, without satisfying its
critics that its credentials are good. It must be admitted,
<i>e.g.</i>, that J. S. Mill's doctrines of production, distribution,
and exchange, are a theory of certain economic processes,
and that he deals in a consistent and effective fashion with
the sequences of fact that make up his subject-matter.
So, also, Cairnes's discussion of normal value, of the rate
of wages, and of international trade, are excellent instances
of a theoretical handling of economic processes
of sequence and the orderly unfolding development of
-----File: 067.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
fact. But an attempt to cite Mill and Cairnes as exponents
of an evolutionary economics will produce no better
effect than perplexity, and not a great deal of that. Very
much of monetary theory might be cited to the same purpose
and with the like effect. Something similar is true
even of late writers who have avowed some penchant for
the evolutionary point of view; as, <i>e.g.</i>, Professor Hadley,--to
cite a work of unquestioned merit and unusual
reach. Measurably, he keeps the word of promise to the
ear; but any one who may cite his <i>Economics</i> as having
brought political economy into line as an evolutionary science
will convince neither himself nor his interlocutor.
Something to the like effect may fairly be said of the published
work of that later English strain of economists represented
by Professors Cunningham and Ashley, and Mr.
Cannan, to name but a few of the more eminent figures
in the group.

Of the achievements of the classical economists, recent
and living, the science may justly be proud; but they fall
short of the evolutionist's standard of adequacy, not in
failing to offer a theory of a process or of a developmental
relation, but through conceiving their theory in terms
alien to the evolutionist's habits of thought. The difference
between the evolutionary and the pre-evolutionary
sciences lies not in the insistence on facts. There was a
great and fruitful activity in the natural sciences in collecting
and collating facts before these sciences took on
the character which marks them as evolutionary. Nor
does the difference lie in the absence of efforts to formulate
and explain schemes of process, sequence, growth,
and development in the pre-evolutionary days. Efforts
of this kind abounded, in number and diversity; and many
schemes of development, of great subtlety and beauty,
gained a vogue both as theories of organic and inorganic
-----File: 068.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\-------
development and as schemes of the life history of nations
and societies. It will not even hold true that our elders
overlooked the presence of cause and effect in formulating
their theories and reducing their data to a body of knowledge.
But the terms which were accepted as the definitive
terms of knowledge were in some degree different in
the early days from what they are now. The terms of
thought in which the investigators of some two or three
generations back definitively formulated their knowledge
of facts, in their last analyses, were different in kind from
the terms in which the modern evolutionist is content to
formulate his results. The analysis does not run back to
the same ground, or appeal to the same standard of finality
or adequacy, in the one case as in the other.

The difference is a difference of spiritual attitude or
point of view in the two contrasted generations of scientists.
To put the matter in other words, it is a difference
in the basis of valuation of the facts for the scientific purpose,
or in the interest from which the facts are appreciated.
With the earlier as with the later generation the
basis of valuation of the facts handled is, in matters of
detail, the causal relation which is apprehended to subsist
between them. This is true to the greatest extent for the
natural sciences. But in their handling of the more comprehensive
schemes of sequence and relation--in their
definitive formulation of the results--the two generations
differ. The modern scientist is unwilling to depart
from the test of causal relation or quantitative sequence.
When he asks the question, Why? he insists on an answer
in terms of cause and effect. He wants to reduce his
solution of all problems to terms of the conservation of
energy or the persistence of quantity. This is his last
recourse. And this last recourse has in our time been
made available for the handling of schemes of develop-*
-----File: 069.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\-------
*ment and theories of a comprehensive process by the notion
of a cumulative causation. The great deserts of the
evolutionist leaders--if they have great deserts as leaders--lie,
on the one hand, in their refusal to go back of
the colorless sequence of phenomena and seek higher
ground for their ultimate syntheses, and, on the other
hand, in their having shown how this colorless impersonal
sequence of cause and effect can be made use of for
theory proper, by virtue of its cumulative character.

For the earlier natural scientists, as for the classical
economists, this ground of cause and effect is not definitive.
Their sense of truth and substantiality is not satisfied
with a formulation of mechanical sequence. The
ultimate term in their systematisation of knowledge is a
"natural law." This natural law is felt to exercise some
sort of a coercive surveillance over the sequence of
events, and to give a spiritual stability and consistence to
the causal relation at any given juncture. To meet the
high classical requirement, a sequence--and a developmental
process especially--must be apprehended in terms
of a consistent propensity tending to some spiritually
legitimate end. When facts and events have been reduced
to these terms of fundamental truth and have been made
to square with the requirements of definitive normality,
the investigator rests his case. Any causal sequence
which is apprehended to traverse the imputed propensity
in events is a "disturbing factor." Logical congruity
with the apprehended propensity is, in this view, adequate
ground of procedure in building up a scheme of knowledge
or of development. The objective point of the
efforts of the scientists working under the guidance of
this classical tradition, is to formulate knowledge in terms
of absolute truth; and this absolute truth is a spiritual
fact. It means a coincidence of facts with the deliver-*
-----File: 070.png---\Pitirim\LottieBooks\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\--------
*ances of an enlightened and deliberate common sense.

The development and the attenuation of this preconception
of normality or of a propensity in events might be
traced in detail from primitive animism down through the
elaborate discipline of faith and metaphysics, overruling
Providence, order of nature, natural rights, natural law,
underlying principles. But all that may be necessary here
is to point out that, by descent and by psychological content,
this constraining normality is of a spiritual kind.
It is for the scientific purpose an imputation of spiritual
coherence to the facts dealt with. The question of interest
is how this preconception of normality has fared at
the hands of modern science, and how it has come to be
superseded in the intellectual primacy by the latter-day
preconception of a non-spiritual sequence. This question
is of interest because its answer may throw light on
the question as to what chance there is for the indefinite
persistence of this archaic habit of thought in the methods
of economic science.

<tb>

Under primitive conditions, men stand in immediate
personal contact with the material facts of the environment;
and the force and discretion of the individual in
shaping the facts of the environment count obviously, and
to all appearance solely, in working out the conditions of
life. There is little of impersonal or mechanical sequence
visible to primitive men in their every-day life;
and what there is of this kind in the processes of brute
nature about them is in large part inexplicable and passes
for inscrutable. It is accepted as malignant or beneficent,
and is construed in the terms of personality that are
familiar to all men at first hand,--the terms known to
all men by first-hand knowledge of their own acts. The
inscrutable movements of the seasons and of the natural
-----File: 071.png---\siddalp\Lithui\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\-------------
forces are apprehended as actions guided by discretion,
will power, or propensity looking to an end, much as
human actions are. The processes of inanimate nature
are agencies whose habits of life are to be learned, and
who are to be coerced, outwitted, circumvented, and
turned to account, much as the beasts are. At the same
time the community is small, and the human contact of
the individual is not wide. Neither the industrial life nor
the non-industrial social life forces upon men's attention
the ruthless impersonal sweep of events that no man can
withstand or deflect, such as becomes visible in the more
complex and comprehensive life process of the larger
community of a later day. There is nothing decisive to
hinder men's knowledge of facts and events being formulated
in terms of personality--in terms of habit and propensity
and will power.

As time goes on and as the situation departs from this
archaic character,--where it does depart from it,--the
circumstances which condition men's systematisation of
facts change in such a way as to throw the impersonal
character of the sequence of events more and more into
the foreground. The penalties for failure to apprehend
facts in dispassionate terms fall surer and swifter. The
sweep of events is forced home more consistently on men's
minds. The guiding hand of a spiritual agency or a propensity
in events becomes less readily traceable as men's
knowledge of things grows ampler and more searching.
In modern times, and particularly in the industrial countries,
this coercive guidance of men's habits of thought
in the realistic direction has been especially pronounced;
and the effect shows itself in a somewhat reluctant but
cumulative departure from the archaic point of view.
The departure is most visible and has gone farthest in
those homely branches of knowledge that have to do
-----File: 072.png---\siddalp\griff4\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\-------------
immediately with modern mechanical processes, such as
engineering designs and technological contrivances generally.
Of the sciences, those have wandered farthest on
this way (of integration or disintegration, according as
one may choose to view it) that have to do with mechanical
sequence and process; and those have best and longest
retained the archaic point of view intact which--like the
moral, social, or spiritual sciences--have to do with
process and sequence that is less tangible, less traceable by
the use of the senses, and that therefore less immediately
forces upon the attention the phenomenon of sequence as
contrasted with that of propensity.

There is no abrupt transition from the pre-evolutionary
to the post-evolutionary standpoint. Even in those natural
sciences which deal with the processes of life and the
evolutionary sequence of events the concept of dispassionate
cumulative causation has often and effectively been
helped out by the notion that there is in all this some sort
of a meliorative trend that exercises a constraining guidance
over the course of causes and effects. The faith in
this meliorative trend as a concept useful to the science
has gradually weakened, and it has repeatedly been disavowed;
but it can scarcely be said to have yet disappeared
from the field.

The process of change in the point of view, or in the
terms of definitive formulation of knowledge, is a gradual
one; and all the sciences have shared, though in an unequal
degree, in the change that is going forward. Economics
is not an exception to the rule, but it still shows
too many reminiscences of the "natural" and the "normal,"
of "verities" and "tendencies," of "controlling
principles" and "disturbing causes" to be classed as an
evolutionary science. This history of the science shows
a long and devious course of disintegrating animism,--*
-----File: 073.png---\Heregerifa\griff4\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\----------
*from the days of the scholastic writers, who discussed
usury from the point of view of its relation to the divine
suzerainty, to the Physiocrats, who rested their case on
an "<i>ordre naturel</i>" and a "<i>loi naturelle</i>" that decides
what is substantially true and, in a general way, guides
the course of events by the constraint of logical congruence.
There has been something of a change from Adam
Smith, whose recourse in perplexity was to the guidance
of "an unseen hand," to Mill and Cairnes, who formulated
the laws of "natural" wages and "normal" value,
and the former of whom was so well content with his
work as to say, "Happily, there is nothing in the laws of
Value which remains for the present or any future writer
to clear up: the theory of the subject is complete."[4] But
the difference between the earlier and the later point of
view is a difference of degree rather than of kind.

The standpoint of the classical economists, in their
higher or definitive syntheses and generalisations, may not
inaptly be called the standpoint of ceremonial adequacy.
The ultimate laws and principles which they formulated
were laws of the normal or the natural, according to a
preconception regarding the ends to which, in the nature
of things, all things tend. In effect, this preconception
imputes to things a tendency to work out what the instructed
common sense of the time accepts as the adequate
or worthy end of human effort. It is a projection
of the accepted ideal of conduct. This ideal of conduct
is made to serve as a canon of truth, to the extent that the
investigator contents himself with an appeal to its legitimation
for premises that run back of the facts with which he
is immediately dealing, for the "controlling principles"
that are conceived intangibly to underlie the process discussed,
and for the "tendencies" that run beyond the

[Footnote 4: <i>Political Economy</i>, Book III, chap. i.]
-----File: 074.png---\Uwaga Budowa\griff4\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------
situation as it lies before him. As instances of the use
of this ceremonial canon of knowledge may be cited the
"conjectural history" that plays so large a part in the
classical treatment of economic institutions, such as the
normalized accounts of the beginnings of barter in the
transactions of the putative hunter, fisherman, and boat-*builder,
or the man with the plane and the two planks,
or the two men with the basket of apples and the basket
of nuts.[5] Of a similar import is the characterisation of
money as "the great wheel of circulation"[6] or as "the
medium of exchange." Money is here discussed in terms
of the end which, "in the normal case," it should work
out according to the given writer's ideal of economic life,
rather than in terms of causal relation.

With later writers especially, this terminology is no
doubt to be commonly taken as a convenient use of metaphor,
in which the concept of normality and propensity to
an end has reached an extreme attenuation. But it is
precisely in this use of figurative terms for the formulation
of theory that the classical normality still lives its
attenuated life in modern economics; and it is this facile
recourse to inscrutable figures of speech as the ultimate
terms of theory that has saved the economists from being
dragooned into the ranks of modern science. The metaphors
are effective, both in their homiletical use and as a
labor-saving device,--more effective than their user designs
them to be. By their use the theorist is enabled
serenely to enjoin himself from following out an elusive
train of causal sequence. He is also enabled, without
misgivings, to construct a theory of such an institution

[Footnote 5: Marshall, <i>Principles of Economics</i> (2d ed.), Book V, chap.
ii, p. 395, note.]

[Footnote 6: Adam Smith, <i>Wealth of Nations</i> (Bohn ed.), Book II, chap.
ii, p. 289.]
-----File: 075.png---\KevinPhilippines\griff4\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\----
as money or wages or land-ownership without descending
to a consideration of the living items concerned, except
for convenient corroboration of his normalised scheme of
symptoms. By this method the theory of an institution
or a phase of life may be stated in conventionalised terms
of the apparatus whereby life is carried on, the apparatus
being invested with a tendency to an equilibrium at the
normal, and the theory being a formulation of the conditions
under which this putative equilibrium supervenes.
In this way we have come into the usufruct of a cost-of-production
theory of value which is pungently reminiscent
of the time when Nature abhorred a vacuum. The ways
and means and the mechanical structure of industry are
formulated in a conventionalised nomenclature, and the
observed motions of this mechanical apparatus are then
reduced to a normalised scheme of relations. The scheme
so arrived at is spiritually binding on the behavior of the
phenomena contemplated. With this normalised scheme
as a guide, the permutations of a given segment of the
apparatus are worked out according to the values assigned
the several items and features comprised in the calculation;
and a ceremonially consistent formula is constructed
to cover that much of the industrial field. This is the
deductive method. The formula is then tested by comparison
with observed permutations, by the polariscopic
use of the "normal case"; and the results arrived at are
thus authenticated by induction. Features of the process
that do not lend themselves to interpretation in the terms
of the formula are abnormal cases and are due to disturbing
causes. In all this the agencies or forces causally at
work in the economic life process are neatly avoided.
The outcome of the method, at its best, is a body of logically
consistent propositions concerning the normal relations
of things--a system of economic taxonomy. At
-----File: 076.png---\sgraph87\nebogipfel\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------
its worst, it is a body of maxims for the conduct of business
and a polemical discussion of disputed points of
policy.

In all this, economic science is living over again in its
turn the experiences which the natural sciences passed
through some time back. In the natural sciences the
work of the taxonomist was and continues to be of great
value, but the scientists grew restless under the r√©gime of
symmetry and system-making. They took to asking why,
and so shifted their inquiries from the structure of the
coral reefs to the structure and habits of life of the polyp
that lives in and by them. In the science of plants, systematic
botany has not ceased to be of service; but the
stress of investigation and discussion among the botanists
to-day falls on the biological value of any given feature of
structure, function, or tissue rather than on its taxonomic
bearing. All the talk about cytoplasm, centrosomes, and
karyokinetic process, means that the inquiry now looks
consistently to the life process, and aims to explain it in
terms of cumulative causation.

What may be done in economic science of the taxonomic
kind is shown at its best in Cairnes's work, where
the method is well conceived and the results effectively
formulated and applied. Cairnes handles the theory of
the normal case in economic life with a master hand. In
his discussion the metaphysics of propensity and tendencies
no longer avowedly rules the formulation of theory,
nor is the inscrutable meliorative trend of a harmony of
interests confidently appealed to as an engine of definitive
use in giving legitimacy to the economic situation at a
given time. There is less of an exercise of faith in
Cairnes's economic discussions than in those of the writers
that went before him. The definitive terms of the formulation
are still the terms of normality and natural law, but
-----File: 077.png---\sgraph87\nebogipfel\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------
the metaphysics underlying this appeal to normality is so
far removed from the ancient ground of the beneficent
"order of nature" as to have become at least nominally
impersonal and to proceed without a constant regard to
the humanitarian bearing of the "tendencies" which it
formulates. The metaphysics has been attenuated to
something approaching in colorlessness the naturalist's
conception of natural law. It is a natural law which, in
the guise of "controlling principles," exercises a constraining
surveillance over the trend of things; but it is no
longer conceived to exercise its constraint in the interest
of certain ulterior human purposes. The element of
beneficence has been well-nigh eliminated, and the system
is formulated in terms of the system itself. Economics as
it left Cairnes's hand, so far as his theoretical work is concerned,
comes near being taxonomy for taxonomy's sake.

No equally capable writer has come as near making
economics the ideal "dismal" science as Cairnes in his
discussion of pure theory. In the days of the early classical
writers economics had a vital interest for the laymen
of the time, because it formulated the common sense
metaphysics of the time in its application to a department
of human life. But in the hands of the later classical
writers the science lost much of its charm in this regard.
It was no longer a definition and authentication of the
deliverances of current common sense as to what ought to
come to pass; and it, therefore, in large measure lost the
support of the people out of doors, who were unable to
take an interest in what did not concern them; and it
was also out of touch with that realistic or evolutionary
habit of mind which got under way about the middle of
the century in the natural sciences. It was neither
vitally metaphysical nor matter-of-fact, and it found comfort
with very few outside of its own ranks. Only for
-----File: 078.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\gst\thorgon\Hermit00\-----------
those who by the fortunate accident of birth or education
have been able to conserve the taxonomic animus has the
science during the last third of a century continued to be
of absorbing interest. The result has been that from the
time when the taxonomic structure stood forth as a completed
whole in its symmetry and stability the economists
themselves, beginning with Cairnes, have been growing
restive under its discipline of stability, and have made
many efforts, more or less sustained, to galvanise it into
movement. At the hands of the writers of the classical
line these excursions have chiefly aimed at a more complete
and comprehensive taxonomic scheme of permutations;
while the historical departure threw away the taxonomic
ideal without getting rid of the preconceptions on
which it is based; and the later Austrian group struck
out on a theory of process, but presently came to a full
stop because the process about which they busied themselves
was not, in their apprehension of it, a cumulative
or unfolding sequence.

<tb>

But what does all this signify? If we are getting restless
under the taxonomy of a monocotyledonous wage
doctrine and a cryptogamic theory of interest, with involute,
loculicidal, tomentous and moniliform variants,
what is the cytoplasm, centrosome, or karyokinetic process
to which we may turn, and in which we may find surcease
from the metaphysics of normality and controlling
principles? What are we going to do about it? The
question is rather, What are we doing about it? There
is the economic life process still in great measure awaiting
theoretical formulation. The active material in which
the economic process goes on is the human material of
the industrial community. For the purpose of economic
science the process of cumulative change that is to be
-----File: 079.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\gst\thorgon\Hermit00\-----------
accounted for is the sequence of change in the methods
of doing things,--the methods of dealing with the material
means of life.

What has been done in the way of inquiry into this
economic life process? The ways and means of turning
material objects and circumstances to account lie before
the investigator at any given point of time in the form of
mechanical contrivances and arrangements for compassing
certain mechanical ends. It has therefore been easy to
accept these ways and means as items of inert matter
having a given mechanical structure and thereby serving
the material ends of man. As such, they have been scheduled
and graded by the economists under the head of
capital, this capital being conceived as a mass of material
objects serviceable for human use. This is well enough
for the purposes of taxonomy; but it is not an effective
method of conceiving the matter for the purpose of a
theory of the developmental process. For the latter purpose,
when taken as items in a process of cumulative
change or as items in the scheme of life, these productive
goods are facts of human knowledge, skill, and predilection;
that is to say, they are, substantially, prevalent
habits of thought, and it is as such that they enter into
the process of industrial development. The physical
properties of the materials accessible to man are constants:
it is the human agent that changes,--his insight
and his appreciation of what these things can be used for
is what develops. The accumulation of goods already on
hand conditions his handling and utilisation of the materials
offered, but even on this side--the "limitation of
industry by capital"--the limitation imposed is on what
men can do and on the methods of doing it. The changes
that take place in the mechanical contrivances are an
expression of changes in the human factor. Changes in
-----File: 080.png---\Pitirim\francisgoode\gst\thorgon\Hermit00\-----------
the material facts breed further change only through the
human factor. It is in the human material that the continuity
of development is to be looked for; and it is here,
therefore, that the motor forces of the process of economic
development must be studied if they are to be studied
in action at all. Economic action must be the subject-matter
of the science if the science is to fall into line as
an evolutionary science.

Nothing new has been said in all this. But the fact is
all the more significant for being a familiar fact. It is a
fact recognised by common consent throughout much of
the later economic discussion, and this current recognition
of the fact is a long step towards centering discussion and
inquiry upon it. If economics is to follow the lead or
the analogy of the other sciences that have to do with a
life process, the way is plain so far as regards the general
direction in which the move will be made.

The economists of the classical trend have made no serious
attempt to depart from the standpoint of taxonomy
and make their science a genetic account of the economic
life process. As has just been said, much the same is true
for the Historical School. The latter have attempted an
account of developmental sequence, but they have followed
the lines of pre-Darwinian speculations on development
rather than lines which modern science would
recognise as evolutionary. They have given a narrative
survey of phenomena, not a genetic account of an unfolding
process. In this work they have, no doubt, achieved
results of permanent value; but the results achieved are
scarcely to be classed as economic theory. On the other
hand, the Austrians and their precursors and their coadjutors
in the value discussion have taken up a detached
portion of economic theory, and have inquired with great
nicety into the process by which the phenomena within
-----File: 081.png---\Pitirim\natdp\gst\thorgon\Hermit00\------------------
their limited field are worked out. The entire discussion
of marginal utility and subjective value as the outcome of
a valuation process must be taken as a genetic study of
this range of facts. But here, again, nothing further has
come of the inquiry, so far as regards a rehabilitation of
economic theory as a whole. Accepting Menger as their
spokesman on this head, it must be said that the Austrians
have on the whole showed themselves unable to
break with the classical tradition that economics is a
taxonomic science.

The reason for the Austrian failure seems to lie in a
faulty conception of human nature,--faulty for the present
purpose, however adequate it may be for any other.
In all the received formulations of economic theory,
whether at the hands of English economists or those of
the Continent, the human material with which the inquiry
is concerned is conceived in hedonistic terms; that is to
say, in terms of a passive and substantially inert and immutably
given human nature. The psychological and anthropological
preconceptions of the economists have been
those which were accepted by the psychological and social
sciences some generations ago. The hedonistic conception
of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures
and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule
of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli
that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He
has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated,
definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for
the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in
one direction or another. Self-imposed in elemental
space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis
until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him,
whereupon he follows the line of the resultant. When
the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-*
-----File: 082.png---\Pitirim\natdp\gst\thorgon\Hermit00\------------------
*contained globule of desire as before. Spiritually, the
hedonistic man is not a prime mover. He is not the seat
of a process of living, except in the sense that he is subject
to a series of permutations enforced upon him by
circumstances external and alien to him.

The later psychology, re√´nforced by modern anthropological
research, gives a different conception of
human nature. According to this conception, it is the
characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer
pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces.
He is not simply a bundle of desires that are to be saturated
by being placed in the path of the forces of the environment,
but rather a coherent structure of propensities
and habits which seeks realisation and expression in an
unfolding activity. According to this view, human activity,
and economic activity among the rest, is not apprehended
as something incidental to the process of saturating
given desires. The activity is itself the substantial
fact of the process, and the desires under whose guidance
the action takes place are circumstances of temperament
which determine the specific direction in which the
activity will unfold itself in the given case. These circumstances
of temperament are ultimate and definitive
for the individual who acts under them, so far as regards
his attitude as agent in the particular action in which he
is engaged. But, in the view of the science, they are elements
of the existing frame of mind of the agent, and are
the outcome of his antecedents and his life up to the point
at which he stands. They are the products of his hereditary
traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought
out under a given body of traditions, conventionalities,
and material circumstances; and they afford the point of
departure for the next step in the process. The economic
life history of the individual is a cumulative process of
-----File: 083.png---\Pitirim\natdp\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------------
adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as
the process goes on, both the agent and his environment
being at any point the outcome of the last process. His
methods of life to-day are enforced upon him by his habits
of life carried over from yesterday and by the circumstances
left as the mechanical residue of the life of
yesterday.

What is true of the individual in this respect is true
of the group in which he lives. All economic change is
a change in the economic community,--a change in the
community's methods of turning material things to account.
The change is always in the last resort a change
in habits of thought. This is true even of changes in the
mechanical processes of industry. A given contrivance
for effecting certain material ends becomes a circumstance
which affects the further growth of habits of thought--habitual
methods of procedure--and so becomes a point
of departure for further development of the methods of
compassing the ends sought and for the further variation
of ends that are sought to be compassed. In all this flux
there is no definitively adequate method of life and no
definitive or absolutely worthy end of action, so far as
concerns the science which sets out to formulate a theory
of the process of economic life. What remains as a hard
and fast residue is the fact of activity directed to an objective
end. Economic action is teleological, in the sense
that men always and everywhere seek to do something.
What, in specific detail, they seek, is not to be answered
except by a scrutiny of the details of their activity; but,
so long as we have to do with their life as members of
the economic community, there remains the generic fact
that their life is an unfolding activity of a teleological
kind.

It may or may not be a teleological process in the sense
-----File: 084.png---\Pitirim\natdp\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------------
that it tends or should tend to any end that is conceived
to be worthy or adequate by the inquirer or by the consensus
of inquirers. Whether it is or is not, is a question
with which the present inquiry is not concerned; and it is
also a question of which an evolutionary economics need
take no account. The question of a tendency in events
can evidently not come up except on the ground of some
preconception or prepossession on the part of the person
looking for the tendency. In order to search for a tendency,
we must be possessed of some notion of a definitive
end to be sought, or some notion as to what is the legitimate
trend of events. The notion of a legitimate trend
in a course of events is an extra-evolutionary preconception,
and lies outside the scope of an inquiry into the
causal sequence in any process. The evolutionary point
of view, therefore, leaves no place for a formulation of
natural laws in terms of definitive normality, whether in
economics or in any other branch of inquiry. Neither
does it leave room for that other question of normality,
What should be the end of the developmental process
under discussion?

The economic life history of any community is its life
history in so far as it is shaped by men's interest in the
material means of life. This economic interest has
counted for much in shaping the cultural growth of all
communities. Primarily and most obviously, it has
guided the formation, the cumulative growth, of that
range of conventionalities and methods of life that are
currently recognized as economic institutions; but the
same interest has also pervaded the community's life and
its cultural growth at points where the resulting structural
features are not chiefly and most immediately of an
economic bearing. The economic interest goes with men
through life, and it goes with the race throughout its pro-*
-----File: 085.png---\Pitirim\natdp\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\--------------
*cess of cultural development. It affects the cultural
structure at all points, so that all institutions may be said
to be in some measure economic institutions. This is
necessarily the case, since the base of action--the point
of departure--at any step in the process is the entire
organic complex of habits of thought that have been
shaped by the past process. The economic interest does
not act in isolation, for it is but one of several vaguely
isolable interests on which the complex of teleological
activity carried out by the individual proceeds. The individual
is but a single agent in each case; and he enters
into each successive action as a whole, although the
specific end sought in a given action may be sought
avowedly on the basis of a particular interest; as <i>e.g.</i>,
the economic, √¶sthetic, sexual, humanitarian, devotional
interests. Since each of these passably isolable
interests is a propensity of the organic agent man,
with his complex of habits of thought, the expression
of each is affected by habits of life formed under the
guidance of all the rest. There is, therefore, no neatly
isolable range of cultural phenomena that can be rigorously
set apart under the head of economic institutions,
although a category of "economic institutions" may be of
service as a convenient caption, comprising those institutions
in which the economic interest most immediately
and consistently finds expression, and which most immediately
and with the least limitation are of an economic
bearing.

From what has been said it appears that an evolutionary
economics must be the theory of a process of cultural
growth as determined by the economic interest, a theory
of a cumulative sequence of economic institutions stated
in terms of the process itself. Except for the want of
space to do here what should be done in some detail if it
-----File: 086.png---\Pitirim\sallys92\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\-----------
is done at all, many efforts by the later economists in this
direction might be cited to show the trend of economic
discussion in this direction. There is not a little evidence
to this effect, and much of the work done must be rated
as effective work for this purpose. Much of the work of
the Historical School, for instance, and that of its later
exponents especially, is too noteworthy to be passed over
in silence, even with all due regard to the limitations of
space.

We are now ready to return to the question why economics
is not an evolutionary science. It is necessarily
the aim of such an economics to trace the cumulative
working-out of the economic interest in the cultural sequence.
It must be a theory of the economic life process
of the race or the community. The economists have accepted
the hedonistic preconceptions concerning human
nature and human action, and the conception of the economic
interest which a hedonistic psychology gives does
not afford material for a theory of the development of
human nature. Under hedonism the economic interest is
not conceived in terms of action. It is therefore not
readily apprehended or appreciated in terms of a cumulative
growth of habits of thought, and does not provoke,
even if it did lend itself to, treatment by the evolutionary
method. At the same time the anthropological preconceptions
current in that common-sense apprehension of
human nature to which economists have habitually turned
has not enforced the formulation of human nature in
terms of a cumulative growth of habits of life. These received
anthropological preconceptions are such as have
made possible the normalized conjectural accounts of
primitive barter with which all economic readers are familiar,
and the no less normalized conventional derivation
of landed property and its rent, or the sociologico-philo-*
-----File: 087.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\---------
*sophical discussions of the "function" of this or that
class in the life of society or of the nation.

The premises and the point of view required for an evolutionary
economics have been wanting. The economists
have not had the materials for such a science ready to
their hand, and the provocation to strike out in such a
direction has been absent. Even if it has been possible
at any time to turn to the evolutionary line of speculation
in economics, the possibility of a departure is not enough
to bring it about. So long as the habitual view taken of a
given range of facts is of the taxonomic kind and the
material lends itself to treatment by that method, the taxonomic
method is the easiest, gives the most gratifying
immediate results, and bests[**?best] fits into the accepted body of
knowledge of the range of facts in question. This has
been the situation in economics. The other sciences of
its group have likewise been a body of taxonomic discipline,
and departures from the accredited method have
lain under the odium of being meretricious innovations.
The well-worn paths are easy to follow and lead into good
company. Advance along them visibly furthers the accredited
work which the science has in hand. Divergence
from the paths means tentative work, which is necessarily
slow and fragmentary and of uncertain value.

It is only when the methods of the science and the syntheses
resulting from their use come to be out of line with
habits of thought that prevail in other matters that the
scientist grows restive under the guidance of the received
methods and standpoints, and seeks a way out. Like
other men, the economist is an individual with but one
intelligence. He is a creature of habits and propensities
given through the antecedents, hereditary and cultural, of
which he is an outcome; and the habits of thought formed
in any one line of experience affect his thinking in any
-----File: 088.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\granjan\Hermit00\-------------
other. Methods of observation and of handling facts that
are familiar through habitual use in the general range of
knowledge, gradually assert themselves in any given special
range of knowledge. They may be accepted slowly
and with reluctance where their acceptance involves innovation;
but, if they have the continued backing of the general
body of experience, it is only a question of time
when they shall come into dominance in the special field.
The intellectual attitude and the method of correlation enforced
upon us in the apprehension and assimilation of
facts in the more elementary ranges of knowledge that
have to do with brute facts assert themselves also when
the attention is directed to those phenomena of the life
process with which economics has to do; and the range
of facts which are habitually handled by other methods
than that in traditional vogue in economics has now become
so large and so insistently present at every turn that
we are left restless, if the new body of facts cannot be
handled according to the method of mental procedure
which is in this way becoming habitual.

In the general body of knowledge in modern times the
facts are apprehended in terms of causal sequence. This
is especially true of that knowledge of brute facts which is
shaped by the exigencies of the modern mechanical industry.
To men thoroughly imbued with this matter-of-fact
habit of mind the laws and theorems of economics, and
of the other sciences that treat of the normal course of
things, have a character of "unreality" and futility that
bars out any serious interest in their discussion. The
laws and theorems are "unreal" to them because they are
not to be apprehended in the terms which these men make
use of in handling the facts with which they are perforce
habitually occupied. The same matter-of-fact spiritual
attitude and mode of procedure have now made their way
-----File: 089.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\thorgon\Hermit00\---------
well up into the higher levels of scientific knowledge, even
in the sciences which deal in a more elementary way with
the same human material that makes the subject-matter of
economics, and the economists themselves are beginning
to feel the unreality of their theorems about "normal"
cases. Provided the practical exigencies of modern industrial
life continue of the same character as they now
are, and so continue to enforce the impersonal method of
knowledge, it is only a question of time when that (substantially
animistic) habit of mind which proceeds on the
notion of a definitive normality shall be displaced in the
field of economic inquiry by that (substantially materialistic)
habit of mind which seeks a comprehension of facts
in terms of a cumulative sequence.

The later method of apprehending and assimilating
facts and handling them for the purposes of knowledge
may be better or worse, more or less worthy or adequate,
than the earlier; it may be of greater or less ceremonial
or √¶sthetic effect; we may be moved to regret the incursion
of underbred habits of thought into the scholar's
domain. But all that is beside the present point. Under
the stress of modern technological exigencies, men's everyday
habits of thought are falling into the lines that in the
sciences constitute the evolutionary method; and knowledge
which proceeds on a higher, more archaic plane is
becoming alien and meaningless to them. The social and
political sciences must follow the drift, for they are already
caught in it.

THE PRECONCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC
SCIENCE[1]

I


In an earlier paper[2] the view has been expressed that
the economics handed down by the great writers of a past
generation is substantially a taxonomic science. A view
of much the same purport, so far as concerns the point
here immediately in question, is presented in an admirably
lucid and cogent way by Professor Clark in a recent
number of this journal.[3] There is no wish hereby to
burden Professor Clark with a putative sponsorship of
any ungraceful or questionable generalisations reached in
working outward from this main position, but expression
may not be denied the comfort which his unintended authentication
of the main position affords. It is true, Professor
Clark does not speak of taxonomy, but employs the
term "statics," which is perhaps better suited to his immediate
purpose. Nevertheless, in spite of the high authority
given the term "statics," in this connection, through
its use by Professor Clark and by other writers eminent in
the science, it is fairly to be questioned whether the term
can legitimately be used to characterize the received economic
theories. The word is borrowed from the jargon
of physics, where it is used to designate the theory of

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly Journal of
Economics</i>, vol. xiii, Jan., 1899.]

[Footnote 2: "Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science?" <i>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, July, 1898.]

[Footnote 3: "The Future of Economic Theory," <i>ibid.</i>, October, 1898.]
-----File: 091.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
bodies at rest or of forces in equilibrium. But there is
much in the received economic theories to which the analogy
of bodies at rest or of forces in equilibrium will not
apply. It is perhaps not too much to say that those articles
of economic theory that do not lend themselves to
this analogy make up the major portion of the received
doctrines. So, for instance, it seems scarcely to the point
to speak of the statics of production, exchange, consumption,
circulation. There are, no doubt, appreciable elements
in the theory of these several processes that may
fairly be characterized as statical features of the theory;
but the doctrines handed down are after all, in the main,
theories of the process discussed under each head, and
the theory of a process does not belong in statics. The
epithet "statical" would, for instance, have to be
wrenched somewhat ungently to make it apply to Quesnay's
classic <i>Tableau √âconomique</i> or to the great body of
Physiocratic speculations that take their rise from it
The like is true for Books II. and III. of Adam Smith's
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, as also for considerable portions of
Ricardo's work, or, to come down to the present generation,
for much of Marshall's <i>Principles</i>, and for such a
modern discussion as Smart's <i>Studies in Economics</i>, as
well as for the fruitful activity of the Austrians and of
the later representatives of the Historical School.

But to return from this terminological digression.
While economic science in the remoter past of its history
has been mainly of a taxonomic character, later writers of
all schools show something of a divergence from the taxonomic
line and an inclination to make the science a genetic
account of the economic life process, sometimes even
without an ulterior view to the taxonomic value of the
results obtained. This divergence from the ancient
canons of theoretical formulation is to be taken as an
-----File: 092.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
episode of the movement that is going forward in latter-*day
science generally; and the progressive change which
thus affects the ideals and the objective point of the modern
sciences seems in its turn to be an expression of that
matter-of-fact habit of mind which the prosy but exacting
exigencies of life in a modern industrial community
breed in men exposed to their unmitigated impact.

In speaking of this matter-of-fact character of the modern
sciences it has been broadly characterized as "evolutionary";
and the evolutionary method and the evolutionary
ideals have been placed in antithesis to the taxonomic
methods and ideals of pre-evolutionary days. But the
characteristic attitude, aims, and ideals which are so designated
here are by no means peculiar to the group of sciences
that are professedly occupied with a process of development,
taking that term in its most widely accepted
meaning. The latter-day inorganic sciences are in this
respect like the organic. They occupy themselves with
"dynamic" relations and sequences. The question which
they ask is always, What takes place next, and why?
Given a situation wrought out by the forces under inquiry,
what follows as the consequence of the situation so
wrought out? or what follows upon the accession of a
further element of force? Even in so non-evolutionary a
science as inorganic chemistry the inquiry consistently
runs on a process, an active sequence, and the value of the
resulting situation as a point of departure for the next
step in an interminable cumulative sequence. The last
step in the chemist's experimental inquiry into any substance
is, What comes of the substance determined?
What will it do? What will it lead to, when it is made
the point of departure in further chemical action? There
is no ultimate term, and no definitive solution except in
terms of further action. The theory worked out is al-*
-----File: 093.png---\Pitirim\sallys92\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
*ways a theory of a genetic succession of phenomena, and
the relations determined and elaborated into a body of
doctrine are always genetic relations. In modern chemistry
no cognisance is taken of the honorific bearing of
reactions or molecular formul√¶. The modern chemist, as
contrasted with his ancient congener, knows nothing of
the worth, elegance, or cogency of the relations that may
subsist between the particles of matter with which he
busies himself, for any other than the genetic purpose.
The spiritual element and the elements of worth and propensity
no longer count. Alchemic symbolism and the
hierarchical glamour and virtue that once hedged about
the nobler and more potent elements and reagents are almost
altogether a departed glory of the science. Even the
modest imputation of propensity involved in the construction
of a scheme of coercive normality, for the putative
guidance of reactions, finds little countenance with the
later adepts of chemical science. The science has outlived
that phase of its development at which the taxonomic
feature was the dominant one.

In the modern sciences, of which chemistry is one,
there has been a gradual shifting of the point of view
from which the phenomena which the science treats of are
apprehended and passed upon; and to the historian of
chemical science this shifting of the point of view must
be a factor of great weight in the development of chemical
knowledge. Something of a like nature is true for economic
science; and it is the aim here to present, in outline,
some of the successive phases that have passed over
the spiritual attitude of the adepts of the science, and to
point out the manner in which the transition from one
point of view to the next has been made.

<tb>

As has been suggested in the paper already referred to,
-----File: 094.png---\Pitirim\Vorto\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
the characteristic spiritual attitude or point of view of a
given generation or group of economists is shown not so
much in their detail work as in their higher syntheses--the
terms of their definitive formulations--the grounds
of their final valuation of the facts handled for purpose
of theory. This line of recondite inquiry into the spiritual
past and antecedents of the science has not often been
pursued seriously or with singleness of purpose, perhaps
because it is, after all, of but slight consequence to the
practical efficiency of the present-day science. Still, not
a little substantial work has been done towards this end
by such writers as Hasbach, Oncken, Bonar, Cannan, and
Marshall. And much that is to the purpose is also due to
writers outside of economics, for the aims of economic
speculation have never been insulated from the work
going forward in other lines of inquiry. As would necessarily
be the case, the point of view of economists has
always been in large part the point of view of the enlightened
common sense of their time. The spiritual attitude
of a given generation of economists is therefore in good
part a special outgrowth of the ideals and preconceptions
current in the world about them.

So, for instance, it is quite the conventional thing to
say that the speculations of the Physiocrats were dominated
and shaped by the preconception of Natural Rights.
Account has been taken of the effect of natural-rights
preconceptions upon the Physiocratic schemes of policy
and economic reform as well as upon the details of their
doctrines.[4] But little has been said of the significance of
these preconceptions for the lower courses of the Physiocrats'
theoretical structure. And yet that habit of mind

[Footnote 4: See, for instance, Hasbach, <i>Allgemeine philosophische Grundlagen
der von Francois[** "c" needs a cedilla, P3 √ß] Quesnay und Adam Smith begr√ºndeten
politischen Oekonomie</i>.]
-----File: 095.png---\Pitirim\griff4\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
to which the natural-rights view is wholesome and adequate
is answerable both for the point of departure and
for the objective point of the Physiocratic theories, both
for the range of facts to which they turned and for the
terms in which they were content to formulate their
knowledge of the facts which they handled. The failure
of their critics to place themselves at the Physiocratic
point of view has led to much destructive criticism of
their work; whereas, when seen through Physiocratic
eyes, such doctrines as those of the net product and of
the barrenness of the artisan class appear to be substantially
true.

The speculations of the Physiocrats are commonly accounted
the first articulate and comprehensive presentation
of economic theory that is in line with later theoretical
work. The Physiocratic point of view may, therefore,
well be taken as the point of departure in an attempt to
trace that shifting of aims and norms of procedure that
comes into view in the work of later economists when
compared with earlier writers.

Physiocratic economics is a theory of the working-out
of the Law of Nature (<i>loi naturelle</i>) in its economic bearing,
and this Law of Nature is a very simple matter.

Les lois naturelles sont ou physiques ou morales.

On entend ici, par loi physique, <i>le cours r√©gl√© de tout √©v√®nement

52-53).]
-----File: 096.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\gst\JSMII\Hermit00\---------------

The settled course of material facts tending beneficently
to the highest welfare of the human race,--this is the final
term in the Physiocratic speculations. This is the touchstone
of substantiality. Conformity to these "immutable
and unerring" laws of nature is the test of economic
truth. The laws are immutable and unerring, but that
does not mean that they rule the course of events with a
blind fatality that admits of no exception and no divergence
from the direct line. Human nature may, through
infirmity or perversity, willfully break over the beneficent
trend of the laws of nature; but to the Physiocrat's sense
of the matter the laws are none the less immutable and
irrefragable on that account. They are not empirical
generalisations on the course of phenomena, like the law
of falling bodies or of the angle of reflection; although
many of the details of their action are to be determined
only by observation and experience, helped out, of course,
by interpretation of the facts of observation under the
light of reason. So, for instance, Turgot, in his <i>R√©flections</i>,
empirically works out a doctrine of the reasonable
course of development through which wealth is accumulated
and reaches the existing state of unequal distribution;
so also his doctrines of interest and of money. The
immutable natural laws are rather of the nature of canons
of conduct governing nature than generalisations of mechanical
sequence, although in a general way the phenomena
of mechanical sequence are details of the conduct
of nature working according to these canons of conduct.
The great law of the order of nature is of the character
of a propensity working to an end, to the accomplishment
of a purpose. The processes of nature working under
the quasi-spiritual stress of this immanent propensity may
be characterised as nature's habits of life. Not that nature
is conscious of its travail, and knows and desires the
-----File: 097.png---\Pitirim\Bizzie\gst\JSMII\Hermit00\-------------------
worthy end of its endeavors; but for all that there is a
quasi-spiritual nexus between antecedent and consequent
in the scheme of operation in which nature is engaged.
Nature is not uneasy about interruptions of its course or
occasional deflections from the direct line through an
untoward conjunction of mechanical causes, nor does the
validity of the great overruling law suffer through such
an episode. The introduction of a mere mechanically
effective causal factor cannot thwart the course of Nature
from reaching the goal to which she animistically tends.
Nothing can thwart this teleological propensity of nature
except counter-activity or divergent activity of a similarly
teleological kind. Men can break over the law, and have
short-sightedly and willfully done so; for men are also
agents who guide their actions by an end to be achieved.
Human conduct is activity of the same kind--on the
same plane of spiritual reality or competency--as the
course of Nature, and it may therefore traverse the latter.
The remedy for this short-sighted traffic of misguided human
nature is enlightenment,--"instruction publique et
priv√©e des lois de l'ordre naturel."[6]

The nature in terms of which all knowledge of phenomena--for
the present purpose economic phenomena--is
to be finally synthesised is, therefore, substantially of
a quasi-spiritual or animistic character. The laws of nature
are in the last resort teleological: they are of the
nature of a propensity. The substantial fact in all the
sequences of nature is the end to which the sequence naturally
tends, not the brute fact of mechanical compulsion or
causally effective forces. Economic theory is accordingly
the theory (1) of how the efficient causes of the <i>ordre
naturel</i> work in an orderly unfolding sequence, guided

[Footnote 6: Quesnay, <i>Droit Naturel</i>, ch. v (Ed. Daire, <i>Physiocrates</i>, p.
53).]
-----File: 098.png---\Pitirim\Bizzie\macaw89\msmoose\Hermit00\-------------
by the underlying natural laws--the propensity immanent
in nature to establish the highest well-being of mankind,
and (2) of the conditions imposed upon human conduct
by these natural laws in order to reach the ordained
goal of supreme human welfare. The conditions so imposed
on human conduct are as definitive as the laws and
the order by force of which they are imposed; and the
theoretical conclusions reached, when these laws and this
order are known, are therefore expressions of absolute
economic truth. Such conclusions are an expression of
reality, but not necessarily of fact.

Now, the objective end of this propensity that determines
the course of nature is human well-being. But economic
speculation has to do with the workings of nature
only so far as regards the <i>ordre physique</i>. And the laws
of nature in the <i>ordre physique</i>, working through mechanical
sequence, can only work out the physical well-being
of man, not necessarily the spiritual. This propensity to
the physical well-being of man is therefore the law of
nature to which economic science must bring its generalisations,
and this law of physical beneficence is the substantial
ground of economic truth. Wanting this, all our
speculations are vain; but having its authentication they
are definitive. The great, typical function, to which all
the other functioning of nature is incidental if not subsidiary,
is accordingly that of the alimentation, nutrition
of mankind. In so far, and only in so far as the physical
processes contribute to human sustenance and fullness of
life, can they, therefore, further the great work of nature.
Whatever processes contribute to human sustenance by
adding to the material available for human assimilation
and nutrition, by increasing the substance disposable for
human comfort, therefore count towards the substantial
end. All other processes, however serviceable in other
-----File: 099.png---\Pitirim\alexkrem\macaw89\JSMII\Hermit00\-------------
than this physiological respect, lack the substance of economic
reality. Accordingly, human industry is productive,
economically speaking, if it heightens the effectiveness
of the natural processes out of which the material of
human sustenance emerges; otherwise not. The test of
productivity, of economic reality in material facts, is the
increase of nutritive material. Whatever employment of
time or effort does not afford an increase of such material
is unproductive, however profitable it may be to the person
employed, and however useful or indispensable it may
be to the community. The type of such productive industry
is the husbandman's employment, which yields a substantial
(nutritive) gain. The artisan's work may be
useful to the community and profitable to himself, but its
economic effect does not extend beyond an alteration of
the form in which the material afforded by nature already
lies at hand. It is formally productive only, not really
productive. It bears no part in the creative or generative
work of nature; and therefore it lacks the character of
economic substantiality. It does not enhance nature's
output of vital force. The artisan's labors, therefore,
yield no net product, whereas the husbandman's labors do.

Whatever constitutes a material increment of this output
of vital force is wealth, and nothing else is. The
theory of value contained in this position has not to do
with value according to men's appraisement of the valuable
article. Given items of wealth may have assigned to
them certain relative values at which they exchange, and
these conventional values may differ more or less widely
from the natural or intrinsic value of the goods in question;
but all that is beside the substantial point. The
point in question is not the degree of predilection shown
by certain individuals or bodies of men for certain goods.
That is a matter of caprice and convention, and it does not
-----File: 100.png---\Pitirim\alexkrem\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
directly touch the substantial ground of the economic life.
The question of value is a question of the extent to which
the given item of wealth forwards the end of nature's
unfolding process. It is valuable, intrinsically and really,
in so far as it avails the great work which nature has in
hand.

Nature, then, is the final term in the Physiocratic speculations.
Nature works by impulse and in an unfolding
process, under the stress of a propensity to the accomplishment
of a given end. This propensity, taken as the
final cause that is operative in any situation, furnishes the
basis on which to co√∂rdinate all our knowledge of those
efficient causes through which Nature works to her ends.
For the purpose of economic theory proper, this is the
ultimate ground of reality to which our quest of economic
truth must penetrate. But back of Nature and her works
there is, in the Physiocratic scheme of the universe, the
Creator, by whose all-wise and benevolent power the order
of nature has been established in all the strength and
beauty of its inviolate and immutable perfection. But
the Physiocratic conception of the Creator is essentially a
deistic one: he stands apart from the course of nature
which he has established, and keeps his hands off. In the
last resort, of course, "Dieu seul est producteur. Les
hommes travaillent, receuillent, √©conomisent, conservent;
mais <i>√©conomiser</i> n'est pas <i>produire</i>."[7] But this last
resort does not bring the Creator into economic theory as
a fact to be counted with in formulating economic laws.
He serves a homiletical purpose in the Physiocratic
speculations rather than fills an office essential to the
theory. He comes within the purview of the theory by
way of authentication rather than as a subject of inquiry

[Footnote 7: Dupont de Nemours, <i>Correspondance avec J.-B. Say</i> (Ed.
Daire, <i>Physiocrates</i>, premi√®re partie, p. 399).]
-----File: 101.png---\Pitirim\alexkrem\macaw89\JSMII\Hermit00\-------------
or a term in the formulation of economic knowledge.
The Physiocratic God can scarcely be said to be an
economic fact, but it is otherwise with that Nature whose
ways and means constitute the subject-matter of the
Physiocratic inquiry.

When this natural system of the Physiocratic speculation
is looked at from the side of the psychology of the
investigators, or from that of the logical premises employed,
it is immediately recognised as essentially animistic.
It runs consistently on animistic ground; but it is
animism of a high grade,--highly integrated and enlightened,
but, after all, retaining very much of that primitive
force and na√Øvet√© which characterise the animistic explanations
of phenomena in vogue among the untroubled
barbarians. It is not the disjected animism of the vulgar,
who see a willful propensity--often a willful perversity--in
given objects or situations to work towards a
given outcome, good or bad. It is not the gambler's haphazard
sense of fortuitous necessity or the housewife's
belief in lucky days, numbers or phases of the moon. The
Physiocrat's animism rests on a broader outlook, and does
not proceed by such an immediately impulsive imputation
of propensity. The teleological element--the element of
propensity--is conceived in a large way, unified and harmonised,
as a comprehensive order of nature as a whole.
But it vindicates its standing as a true animism by never
becoming fatalistic and never being confused or confounded
with the sequence of cause and effect. It has
reached the last stage of integration and definition, beyond
which the way lies downward from the high, quasi-spiritual
ground of animism to the tamer levels of normality
and causal uniformities.

There is already discernible a tone of dispassionate and
colorless "tendency" about the Physiocratic animism,
-----File: 102.png---\Pitirim\alexkrem\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
such as to suggest a wavering towards the side of normality.
This is especially visible in such writers as the half-protestant
Turgot. In his discussion of the development
of farming, for instance, Turgot speaks almost entirely
of human motives and the material conditions under
which the growth takes place. There is little metaphysics
in it, and that little does not express the law of nature in
an adequate form. But, after all has been said, it remains
true that the Physiocrat's sense of substantiality is not
satisfied until he reaches the animistic ground; and it
remains true also that the arguments of their opponents
made little impression on the Physiocrats so long as they
were directed to other than this animistic ground of their
doctrine. This is true in great measure even of Turgot,
as witness his controversy with Hume. Whatever criticism
is directed against them on other grounds is met with
impatience, as being inconsequential, if not disingenuous.[8]

To an historian of economic theory the source and the
line of derivation whereby this precise form of the order-of-nature
preconception reached the Physiocrats are of
first-rate importance; but it is scarcely a question to be
taken up here,--in part because it is too large a question
to be handled here, in part because it has met with adequate
treatment at more competent hands,[9] and in part
because it is somewhat beside the immediate point under
discussion. This point is the logical, or perhaps better the
psychological, value of the Physiocrats' preconception, as
a factor in shaping their point of view and the terms of
their definitive formulation of economic knowledge. For
this purpose it may be sufficient to point out that the pre-*

[Footnote 8: See, for instance, the concluding chapters of La Rivi√®re's
<i>Ordre Naturel des Soci√©t√©s Politiques</i>.]

[Footnote 9: E.g., Hasbach, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Bonar, <i>Philosophy and Political
Economy</i>, Book II; Ritchie, <i>Natural Rights</i>.]
-----File: 103.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*conception in question belongs to the generation in which
the Physiocrats lived, and that it is the guiding norm of
all serious thought that found ready assimilation into the
common-sense views of that time. It is the characteristic
and controlling feature of what may be called the common-sense
metaphysics of the eighteenth century, especially
so far as concerns the enlightened French community.

It is to be noted as a point bearing more immediately
on the question in hand that this imputation of final causes
to the course of phenomena expresses a spiritual attitude
which has prevailed, one might almost say, always and
everywhere, but which reached its finest, most effective
development, and found its most finished expression, in
the eighteenth-century metaphysics. It is nothing recondite;
for it meets us at every turn, as a matter of course,
in the vulgar thinking of to-day,--in the pulpit and in
the market place,--although it is not so ingenuous, nor
does it so unquestionedly hold the primacy in the thinking
of any class to-day as it once did. It meets us likewise,
with but little change of features, at all past stages of culture,
late or early. Indeed, it is the most generic feature
of human thinking, so far as regards a theoretical or
speculative formulation of knowledge. Accordingly, it
seems scarcely necessary to trace the lineage of this characteristic
preconception of the era of enlightenment,
through specific channels, back to the ancient philosophers
or jurists of the empire. Some of the specific forms of
its expression--as, for instance, the doctrine of Natural
Rights--are no doubt traceable through medi√¶val channels
to the teachings of the ancients; but there is no need
of going over the brook for water, and tracing back to
specific teachings the main features of that habit of mind
or spiritual attitude of which the doctrines of Natural
-----File: 104.png---\Pitirim\natdp\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
Rights and the Order of Nature are specific elaborations
only. This dominant habit of mind came to the generation
of the Physiocrats on the broad ground of group
inheritance, not by lineal devolution from any one of the
great thinkers of past ages who had thrown its deliverances
into a similarly competent form for the use of his
own generation.

<tb>

In leaving the Physiocratic discipline and the immediate
sphere of Physiocratic influence for British ground, we
are met by the figure of Hume. Here, also, it will be
impracticable to go into details as to the remoter line of
derivation of the specific point of view that we come upon
on making the transition, for reasons similar to those already
given as excuse for passing over the similar question
with regard to the Physiocratic point of view. Hume
is, of course, not primarily an economist; but that placid
unbeliever is none the less a large item in any inventory of
eighteenth-century economic thought. Hume was not
gifted with a facile acceptance of the group inheritance
that made the habit of mind of his generation. Indeed,
he was gifted with an alert, though somewhat histrionic,
skepticism touching everything that was well received.
It is his office to prove all things, though not necessarily
to hold fast that which is good.

Aside from the strain of affectation discernible in
Hume's skepticism, he may be taken as an accentuated
expression of that characteristic bent which distinguishes
British thinking in his time from the thinking of the Continent,
and more particularly of the French. There is in
Hume, and in the British community, an insistence on the
prosy, not to say the seamy, side of human affairs. He is
not content with formulating his knowledge of things in
terms of what ought to be or in terms of the objective
-----File: 105.png---\Pitirim\natdp\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
point of the course of things. He is not even content
with adding to the teleological account of phenomena a
chain of empirical, narrative generalisations as to the
usual course of things. He insists, in season and out of
season, on an exhibition of the efficient causes engaged in
any sequence of phenomena; and he is skeptical--irreverently
skeptical--as to the need or the use of any formulation
of knowledge that outruns the reach of his own
matter-of-fact, step-by-step argument from cause to
effect.

In short, he is too modern to be wholly intelligible to
those of his contemporaries who are most neatly abreast
of their time. He out-Britishes the British; and, in his
footsore quest for a perfectly tame explanation of things,
he finds little comfort, and indeed scant courtesy, at the
hands of his own generation. He is not in sufficiently
na√Øve accord with the range of preconceptions then in
vogue.

But, while Hume may be an accentuated expression of
a national characteristic, he is not therefore an untrue
expression of this phase of British eighteenth-century
thinking. The peculiarity of point of view and of method
for which he stands has sometimes been called the critical
attitude, sometimes the inductive method, sometimes the
materialistic or mechanical, and again, though less aptly,
the historical method. Its characteristic is an insistence
on matter of fact.

This matter-of-fact animus that meets any historian of
economic doctrine on his introduction to British economics
is a large, but not the largest, feature of the British
scheme of early economic thought. It strikes the attention
because it stands in contrast with the relative absence
of this feature in the contemporary speculations of
the Continent. The most potent, most formative habit of
-----File: 106.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
thought concerned in the early development of economic
teaching on British ground is best seen in the broader
generalisations of Adam Smith, and this more potent
factor in Smith is a bent that is substantially identical
with that which gives consistency to the speculations of
the Physiocrats. In Adam Smith the two are happily
combined, not to say blended; but the animistic habit still
holds the primacy, with the matter-of-fact as a subsidiary
though powerful factor. He is said to have combined
deduction with induction. The relatively great prominence
given the latter marks the line of divergence of
British from French economics, not the line of coincidence;
and on this account it may not be out of place to
look more narrowly into the circumstances to which the
emergence of this relatively greater penchant for a matter-of-fact
explanation of things in the British community is
due.

To explain the characteristic animus for which Hume
stands, on grounds that might appeal to Hume, we should
have to inquire into the peculiar circumstances--ultimately
material circumstances--that have gone to shape
the habitual view of things within the British community,
and that so have acted to differentiate the British preconceptions
from the French, or from the general range of
preconceptions prevalent on the Continent. These peculiar
formative circumstances are no doubt to some extent
racial peculiarities; but the racial complexion of the British
community is not widely different from the French,
and especially not widely different from certain other
Continental communities which are for the present purpose
roughly classed with the French. Race difference
can therefore not wholly, nor indeed for the greater part,
account for the cultural difference of which this difference
in preconceptions is an outcome. Through its cumu-*
-----File: 107.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*lative effect on institutions the race difference must be
held to have had a considerable effect on the habit of
mind of the community; but, if the race difference is in
this way taken as the remoter ground of an institutional
peculiarity, which in its turn has shaped prevalent habits
of thought, then the attention may be directed to the
proximate causes, the concrete circumstances, through
which this race difference has acted, in conjunction with
other ulterior circumstances, to work out the psychological
phenomena observed. Race differences, it may be remarked,
do not so nearly coincide with national lines of
demarcation as differences in the point of view from
which things are habitually apprehended or differences in
the standards according to which facts are rated.

If the element of race difference be not allowed definitive
weight in discussing national peculiarities that underlie
the deliverances of common sense, neither can these
national peculiarities be confidently traced to a national
difference in the transmitted learning that enters into the
common-sense view of things. So far as concerns the
concrete facts embodied in the learning of the various
nations within the European culture, these nations make
up but a single community. What divergence is visible
does not touch the character of the positive information
with which the learning of the various nations is occupied.
Divergence is visible in the higher syntheses, the methods
of handling the material of knowledge, the basis of valuation
of the facts taken up, rather than in the material of
knowledge. But this divergence must be set down to a
cultural difference, a difference of point of view, not to a
difference in inherited information. When a given body
of information passes the national frontiers it acquires a
new complexion, a new national, cultural physiognomy.
It is this cultural physiognomy of learning that is here
-----File: 108.png---\Pitirim\basophil\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-----------
under inquiry, and a comparison of early French economics
(the Physiocrats) with early British economics (Adam
Smith) is here entered upon merely with a view to making
out what significance this cultural physiognomy of the
science has for the past progress of economic speculation.

The broad features of economic speculation, as it stood
at the period under consideration, may be briefly summed
up, disregarding the element of policy, or expediency,
which is common to both groups of economists, and attending
to their theoretical work alone. With the Physiocrats,
as with Adam Smith, there are two main points of
view from which economic phenomena are treated: (<i>a</i>)
the matter-of-fact point of view or preconception, which
yields a discussion of causal sequences and correlations;
and (<i>b</i>) what, for want of a more expressive word, is here
called the animistic point of view or preconception, which
yields a discussion of teleological sequences and correlations,--a
discussion of the function of this and that
"organ," of the legitimacy of this or the other range of
facts. The former preconception is allowed a larger
scope in the British than in the French economics: there
is more of "induction" in the British. The latter preconception
is present in both, and is the definitive element
in both; but the animistic element is more colorless in the
British, it is less constantly in evidence, and less able to
stand alone without the support of arguments from cause
to effect. Still, the animistic element is the controlling
factor in the higher syntheses of both; and for both alike
it affords the definitive ground on which the argument
finally comes to rest. In neither group of thinkers is the
sense of substantiality appeased until this quasi-spiritual
ground, given by the natural propensity of the course of
events, is reached. But the propensity in events, the natural
or normal course of things, as appealed to by the
-----File: 109.png---\Pitirim\basophil\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-----------
British speculators, suggests less of an imputation of will-power,
or personal force, to the propensity in question.
It may be added, as has already been said in another
place, that the tacit imputation of will-power or spiritual
consistency to the natural or normal course of events has
progressively weakened in the later course of economic
speculation, so that in this respect, the British economists
of the eighteenth century may be said to represent a later
phase of economic inquiry than the Physiocrats.

<tb>

Unfortunately, but unavoidably, if this question as to
the cultural shifting of the point of view in economic science
is taken up from the side of the causes to which the
shifting is traceable, it will take the discussion back to
ground on which an economist must at best feel himself
to be but a raw layman, with all a layman's limitations
and ineptitude, and with the certainty of doing badly what
might be done well by more competent hands. But, with
a reliance on charity where charity is most needed, it is
necessary to recite summarily what seems to be the psychological
bearing of certain cultural facts.

A cursory acquaintance with any of the more archaic
phases of human culture enforces the recognition of this
fact,--that the habit of construing the phenomena of the
inanimate world in animistic terms prevails pretty much
universally on these lower levels. Inanimate phenomena
are apprehended to work out a propensity to an end; the
movements of the elements are construed in terms of
quasi-personal force. So much is well authenticated by
the observations on which anthropologists and ethnologists
draw for their materials. This animistic habit, it may be
said, seems to be more effectual and far-reaching among
those primitive communities that lead a predatory life.

But along with this feature of archaic methods of
-----File: 110.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-------------
thought or of knowledge, the picturesqueness of which
has drawn the attention of all observers, there goes a second
feature, no less important for the purpose in hand,
though less obtrusive. The latter is of less interest to
the men who have to do with the theory of cultural development,
because it is a matter of course. This second
feature of archaic thought is the habit of also apprehending
facts in non-animistic, or impersonal, terms. The
imputation of propensity in no case extends to all the
mechanical facts in the case. There is always a substratum
of matter of fact, which is the outcome of an
habitual imputation of causal sequence, or, perhaps better,
an imputation of mechanical continuity, if a new term be
permitted. The agent, thing, fact, event, or phenomenon,
to which propensity, will-power, or purpose, is imputed, is
always apprehended to act in an environment which is
accepted as spiritually inert. There are always opaque
facts as well as self-directing agents. Any agent acts
through means which lend themselves to his use on other
grounds than that of spiritual compulsion, although spiritual
compulsion may be a large feature in any given case.

The same features of human thinking, the same two
complementary methods of correlating facts and handling
them for the purposes of knowledge, are similarly in constant
evidence in the daily life of men in our own community.
The question is, in great part, which of the two
bears the greater part in shaping human knowledge at any
given time and within any given range of knowledge or
of facts.

Other features of the growth of knowledge, which are
remoter from the point under inquiry, may be of no less
consequence to a comprehensive theory of the development
of culture and of thought; but it is of course out of
the question here to go farther afield. The present in-*
-----File: 111.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
*quiry will have enough to do with these two. No other
features are correlative with these, and these merit discussion
on account of their intimate bearing on the point
of view of economics. The point of interest with respect
to these two correlative and complementary habits of
thought is the question of how they have fared under the
changing exigencies of human culture; in what manner
they come, under given cultural circumstances, to share
the field of knowledge between them; what is the relative
part of each in the composite point of view in which the
two habits of thought express themselves at any given
cultural stage.

The animistic preconception enforces the apprehension
of phenomena in terms generically identical with the terms
of personality or individuality. As a certain modern
group of psychologists would say, it imputes to objects
and sequences an element of habit and attention similar
in kind, though not necessarily in degree, to the like spiritual
attitude present in the activities of a personal agent.
The matter-of-fact preconception, on the other hand, enforces
a handling of facts without imputation of personal
force or attention, but with an imputation of mechanical
continuity, substantially the preconception which has
reached a formulation at the hands of scientists under the
name of conservation of energy or persistence of quantity.
Some appreciable resort to the latter method of knowledge
is unavoidable at any cultural stage, for it is indispensable
to all industrial efficiency. All technological
processes and all mechanical contrivances rest, psychologically
speaking, on this ground. This habit of thought
is a selectively necessary consequence of industrial life,
and, indeed, of all human experience in making use of the
material means of life. It should therefore follow that, in
a general way, the higher the culture, the greater the share
-----File: 112.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\msmoose\cmspence\---------
of the mechanical preconception in shaping human
thought and knowledge, since, in a general way, the stage
of culture attained depends on the efficiency of industry.
The rule, while it does not hold with anything like extreme
generality, must be admitted to hold to a good extent;
and to that extent it should hold also that, by a
selective adaptation of men's habits of thought to the
exigencies of those cultural phases that have actually
supervened, the mechanical method of knowledge should
have gained in scope and range. Something of the sort
is borne out by observation.

A further consideration enforces the like view. As the
community increases in size, the range of observation of
the individuals in the community also increases; and continually
wider and more far-reaching sequences of a mechanical
kind have to be taken account of. Men have to
adapt their own motives to industrial processes that are
not safely to be construed in terms of propensity, predilection,
or passion. Life in an advanced industrial community
does not tolerate a neglect of mechanical fact; for
the mechanical sequences through which men, at an appreciable
degree of culture, work out their livelihood, are no
respecters of persons or of will-power. Still, on all but
the higher industrial stages, the coercive discipline of industrial
life, and of the scheme of life that inculcates regard
for the mechanical facts of industry, is greatly mitigated
by the largely haphazard character of industry, and
by the great extent to which man continues to be the prime
mover in industry. So long as industrial efficiency is
chiefly a matter of the handicraftsman's skill, dexterity,
and diligence, the attention of men in looking to the industrial
process is met by the figure of the workman, as the
chief and characteristic factor; and thereby it comes to
run on the personal element in industry.
-----File: 113.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------

But, with or without mitigation, the scheme of life
which men perforce adopt under exigencies of an advanced
industrial situation shapes their habits of thought
on the side of their behavior, and thereby shapes their
habits of thought to some extent for all purposes. Each
individual is but a single complex of habits of thought,
and the same psychical mechanism that expresses itself in
one direction as conduct expresses itself in another direction
as knowledge. The habits of thought formed in the
one connection, in response to stimuli that call for a response
in terms of conduct, must, therefore, have their
effect when the same individual comes to respond to stimuli
that call for a response in terms of knowledge. The
scheme of thought or of knowledge is in good part a reverberation
of the scheme of life. So that, after all has
been said, it remains true that with the growth of industrial
organization and efficiency there must, by selection
and by adaptation, supervene a greater resort to the mechanical
or dispassionate method of apprehending facts.

But the industrial side of life is not the whole of it, nor
does the scheme of life in vogue in any community or at
any cultural stage comprise industrial conduct alone. The
social, civic, military, and religious interests come in for
their share of attention, and between them they commonly
take up by far the larger share of it. Especially is this
true so far as concerns those classes among whom we
commonly look for a cultivation of knowledge for knowledge's
sake. The discipline which these several interests
exert does not commonly coincide with the training given
by industry. So the religious interest, with its canons of
truth and of right living, runs exclusively on personal relations
and the adaptation of conduct to the predilections
of a superior personal agent. The weight of its discipline,
therefore, falls wholly on the animistic side. It
-----File: 114.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
acts to heighten our appreciation of the spiritual bearing
of phenomena and to discountenance a matter-of-fact
apprehension of things. The skeptic of the type of Hume
has never been in good repute with those who stand
closest to the accepted religious truths. The bearing of
this side of our culture upon the development of economics
is shown by what the medi√¶val scholars had to say on
economic topics.

The disciplinary effects of other phases of life, outside
of the industrial and the religious, is not so simple a matter;
but the discussion here approaches nearer to the point
of immediate inquiry,--namely, the cultural situation in
the eighteenth century, and its relation to economic speculation,--and
this ground of interest in the question may
help to relieve the topic of the tedium that of right belongs
to it.

In the remoter past of which we have records, and even
in the more recent past, Occidental man, as well as man
elsewhere, has eminently been a respecter of persons.
Wherever the warlike activity has been a large feature of
the community's life, much of human conduct in society
has proceeded on a regard for personal force. The
scheme of life has been a scheme of personal aggression
and subservience, partly in the na√Øve form, partly conventionalised
in a system of status. The discipline of social
life for the present purpose, in so far as its canons of
conduct rest on this element of personal force in the unconventionalised
form, plainly tends to the formation of a
habit of apprehending and co√∂rdinating facts from the
animistic point of view. So far as we have to do with
life under a system of status, the like remains true, but
with a difference. The r√©gime of status inculcates an unremitting
and very nice discrimination and observance of
distinctions of personal superiority and inferiority. To
-----File: 115.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-------------
the criterion of personal force, or will-power, taken in its
immediate bearing on conduct, is added the criterion of
personal excellence-in-general, regardless of the first-hand
potency of the given person as an agent. This criterion
of conduct requires a constant and painstaking imputation
of personal value, regardless of fact. The discrimination
enjoined by the canons of status proceeds on an invidious
comparison of persons in respect of worth, value, potency,
virtue, which must, for the present purpose, be taken as
putative. The greater or less personal value assigned a
given individual or a given class under the canons of
status is not assigned on the ground of visible effciency[** typo in original - "efficiency" intended?],
but on the ground of a dogmatic allegation accepted on the
strength of an uncontradicted categorical affirmation simply.
The canons of status hold their ground by force of
pre√´mption. Where distinctions of status are based on a
putative worth transmitted by descent from honorable
antecedents, the sequence of transmission to which appeal
is taken as the arbiter of honor is of a putative and animistic
character rather than a visible mechanical continuity.
The habit of accepting as final what is prescriptively
right in the affairs of life has as its reflex in the affairs
of knowledge the formula, <i>Quid ab omnibus, quid ubique
creditur credendum est</i>.

Even this meager account of the scheme of life that
characterises a r√©gime of status should serve to indicate
what is its disciplinary effect in shaping habits of thought,
and therefore in shaping the habitual criteria of knowledge
and of reality. A culture whose institutions are a
framework of invidious comparisons implies, or rather
involves and comprises, a scheme of knowledge whose
definitive standards of truth and substantiality are of an
animistic character; and, the more undividedly the canons
of status and ceremonial honor govern the conduct of the
-----File: 116.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
community, the greater the facility with which the sequence
of cause and effect is made to yield before the
higher claims of a spiritual sequence or guidance in the
course of events. Men consistently trained to an unremitting
discrimination of honor, worth, and personal force
in their daily conduct, and to whom these criteria afford
the definitive ground of sufficiency in co√∂rdinating facts
for the purposes of life, will not be satisfied to fall short
of the like definitive ground of sufficiency when they come
to co√∂rdinate facts for the purposes of knowledge simply.
The habits formed in unfolding his activity in one direction,
under the impulse of a given interest, assert themselves
when the individual comes to unfold his activity in
any other direction, under the impulse of any other interest.
If his last resort and highest criterion of truth in
conduct is afforded by the element of personal force and
invidious comparison, his sense of substantiality or truth
in the quest of knowledge will be satisfied only when a like
definitive ground of animistic force and invidious comparison
is reached. But when such ground is reached he
rests content and pushes the inquiry no farther. In his
practical life he has acquired the habit of resting his case
on an authentic deliverance as to what is absolutely right.
This absolutely right and good final term in conduct has
the character of finality only when conduct is construed
in a ceremonial sense; that is to say, only when life is
conceived as a scheme of conformity to a purpose outside
and beyond the process of living. Under the r√©gime of
status this ceremonial finality is found in the concept of
worth or honor. In the religious domain it is the concept
of virtue, sanctity, or tabu. Merit lies in what one is,
not in what one does. The habit of appeal to ceremonial
finality, formed in the school of status, goes with the individual
in his quest of knowledge, as a dependence upon a
-----File: 117.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
similarly authentic norm of absolute truth,--a similar
seeking of a final term outside and beyond the range of
knowledge.

The discipline of social and civic life under a r√©gime of
status, then, re√´nforces the discipline of the religious life;
and the outcome of the resulting habituation is that the
canons of knowledge are cast in the animistic mold and
converge to a ground of absolute truth, and this absolute
truth is of a ceremonial nature. Its subject-matter is a
reality regardless of fact.

The outcome, for science, of the religious and social life
of the civilisation of status, in Occidental culture, was a
structure of quasi-spiritual appreciations and explanations,
of which astrology, alchemy, and medi√¶val theology
and metaphysics are competent, though somewhat one-*sided,
exponents. Throughout the range of this early
learning the ground of correlation of phenomena is in part
the supposed relative potency of the facts correlated; but
it is also in part a scheme of status, in which facts are
scheduled according to a hierarchical gradation of worth
or merit, having only a ceremonial relation to the observed
phenomena. Some elements (some metals, for instance)
are noble, others base; some planets, on grounds of ceremonial
efficacy, have a sinister influence, others a beneficent
one; and it is a matter of serious consequence
whether they are in the ascendant, and so on.

The body of learning through which the discipline of
animism and invidious comparison transmitted its effects
to the science of economics was what is known as natural
theology, natural rights, moral philosophy, and natural
law. These several disciplines or bodies of knowledge
had wandered far from the na√Øve animistic standpoint at
the time when economic science emerged, and much the
same is true as regards the time of the emergence of other
-----File: 118.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
modern sciences. But the discipline which makes for an
animistic formulation of knowledge continued to hold the
primacy in modern culture, although its dominion was
never altogether undivided or unmitigated. Occidental
culture has long been largely an industrial culture; and,
as already pointed out, the discipline of industry, and of
life in an industrial community, does not favor the animistic
preconception. This is especially true as regards industry
which makes large use of mechanical contrivances.
The difference in these respects between Occidental industry
and science, on the one hand, and the industry and
science of other cultural regions, on the other hand, is
worth noting in this connection. The result has been that
the sciences, as that word is understood in later usage,
have come forward gradually, and in a certain rough parallelism
with the development of industrial processes and
industrial organisation. It is possible to hold that both
modern industry (of the mechanical sort) and modern
science center about the region of the North Sea. It is
still more palpably true that within this general area the
sciences, in the recent past, show a family likeness to the
civil and social institutions of the communities in which
they have been cultivated, this being true to the greatest
extent of the higher or speculative sciences; that is, in
that range of knowledge in which the animistic preconception
can chiefly and most effectively find application.
There is, for instance, in the eighteenth century a perceptible
parallelism between the divergent character of
British and Continental culture and institutions, on the
one hand, and the dissimilar aims of British and Continental
speculation, on the other hand.

Something has already been said of the difference in
preconceptions between the French and the British economists
of the eighteenth century. It remains to point out
-----File: 119.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
the correlative cultural difference between the two communities,
to which it is conceived that the difference in
scientific animus is in great measure due. It is, of course,
only the general features, the general attitude of the speculators,
that can be credited to the difference in culture.
Differences of detail in the specific doctrines held could
be explained only on a much more detailed analysis than
can be entered on here, and after taking account of facts
which cannot here be even allowed for in detail.

Aside from the greater resort to mechanical contrivances
and the larger scale of organisation in British industry,
the further cultural peculiarities of the British community
run in the same general direction. British religious
life and beliefs had less of the element of fealty--personal
or discretionary mastery and subservience--and
more of a tone of fatalism. The civil institutions of the
British had not the same rich personal content as those
of the French. The British subject owned allegiance to
an impersonal law rather than to the person of a superior.
Relatively, it may be said that the sense of status, as
a coercive factor, was in abeyance in the British community.
Even in the warlike enterprise of the British community
a similar characteristic is traceable. Warfare is,
of course, a matter of personal assertion. Warlike communities
and classes are necessarily given to construing
facts in terms of personal force and personal ends. They
are always superstitious. They are great sticklers for
rank and precedent, and zealously cultivate those distinctions
and ceremonial observances in which a system of
status expresses itself. But, while warlike enterprise has
by no means been absent from the British scheme of life,
the geographical and strategic isolation of the British community
has given a characteristic turn to their military
relations. In recent times British warlike operations have
-----File: 120.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
been conducted abroad. The military class has consequently
in great measure been segregated out from the
body of the community, and the ideals and prejudices of
the class have not been transfused through the general
body with the same facility and effect that they might
otherwise have had. The British community at home has
seen the campaign in great part from the standpoint of
the "sinews of war."

The outcome of all these national peculiarities of circumstance
and culture has been that a different scheme of
life has been current in the British community from what
has prevailed on the Continent. There has resulted the
formation of a different body of habits of thought and a
different animus in their handling of facts. The preconception
of causal sequence has been allowed larger scope
in the correlation of facts for purposes of knowledge; and,
where the animistic preconception has been resorted to, as
it always has in the profounder reaches of learning, it has
commonly been an animism of a tamer kind.

Taking Adam Smith as an exponent of this British attitude
in theoretical knowledge, it is to be noted that, while
he formulates his knowledge in terms of a propensity
(natural laws) working teleologically to an end, the end
or objective point which controls the formulation has not
the same rich content of vital human interest or advantage
as is met with in the Physiocratic speculations.
There is perceptibly less of an imperious tone in Adam
Smith's natural laws than in those of the contemporary
French economists. It is true, he sums up the institutions
with which he deals in terms of the ends which they
should subserve, rather than in terms of the exigencies
and habits of life out of which they have arisen; but he
does not with the same tone of finality appeal to the end
subserved as a final cause through whose coercive guid-*
-----File: 121.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
*ance the complex of phenomena is kept to its appointed
task. Under his hands the restraining, compelling agency
retires farther into the background, and appeal is taken
to it neither so directly nor on so slight provocation.

But Adam Smith is too large a figure to be disposed of
in a couple of concluding paragraphs. At the same time
his work and the bent which he gave to economic speculation
are so intimately bound up with the aims and bias
that characterise economics in its next stage of development
that he is best dealt with as the point of departure for
the Classical School rather than merely as a British counterpart
of Physiocracy. Adam Smith will accordingly be
considered in immediate connection with the bias of the
classical school and the incursion of utilitarianism into
economics.

THE PRECONCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC
SCIENCE[1]

II


Adam Smith's animistic bent asserts itself more plainly
and more effectually in the general trend and aim of his
discussion than in the details of theory. "Adam Smith's
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> is, in fact, so far as it has one single
purpose, a vindication of the unconscious law present in
the separate actions of men when these actions are directed
by a certain strong personal motive."[2] Both in the
<i>Theory of the Moral Sentiments</i> and in the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i> there are many passages that testify to his abiding
conviction that there is a wholesome trend in the natural
course of things, and the characteristically optimistic tone
in which he speaks for natural liberty is but an expression
of this conviction. An extreme resort to this animistic
ground occurs in his plea for freedom of investment.[3]

[Footnote 3: "Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out
the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can
command. It is his own advantage, and not that of the society,
which he has in view. But the study of his own advantage
naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him to prefer that employment
which is most advantageous to the society.... By directing
that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the
greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this,
as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an
end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the
worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own]*
-----File: 123.png---\alicat\skovalchik\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\----------

In the proposition that men are "led by an invisible
hand," Smith does not fall back on a meddling Providence
who is to set human affairs straight when they are in
danger of going askew. He conceives the Creator to be
very continent in the matter of interference with the natural
course of things. The Creator has established the
natural order to serve the ends of human welfare; and he
has very nicely adjusted the efficient causes comprised in
the natural order, including human aims and motives, to
this work that they are to accomplish. The guidance of
the invisible hand takes place not by way of interposition,
but through a comprehensive scheme of contrivances
established from the beginning. For the purpose of economic
theory, man is conceived to be consistently self-seeking;
but this economic man is a part of the mechanism
of nature, and his self-seeking traffic is but a means
whereby, in the natural course of things, the general welfare
is worked out. The scheme as a whole is guided by
the end to be reached, but the sequence of events through
which the end is reached is a causal sequence which is
not broken into episodically. The benevolent work of
guidance was performed in first establishing an ingenious
mechanism of forces and motives capable of accomplishing
an ordained result, and nothing beyond the enduring
constraint of an established trend remains to enforce the
divine purpose in the resulting natural course of things.

The sequence of events, including human motives and
human conduct, is a causal sequence; but it is also something
more, or, rather, there is also another element of
continuity besides that of brute cause and effect, present
even in the step-by-step process whereby the natural

*[Footnote: interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually
than when he really intends to promote it." <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, Book IV, chap. ii.]
-----File: 124.png---\Pitirim\skovalchik\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
course of things reaches its final term. The presence of
such a quasi-spiritual or non-causal element is evident
from two (alleged) facts. (1) The course of things may
be deflected from the direct line of approach to that consummate
human welfare which is its legitimate end. The
natural trend of things may be overborne by an untoward
conjuncture of causes. There is a distinction, often distressingly
actual and persistent, between the legitimate
and the observed course of things. If "natural," in
Adam Smith's use, meant necessary, in the sense of causally
determined, no divergence of events from the natural
or legitimate course of things would be possible. If the
mechanism of nature, including man, were a mechanically
competent contrivance for achieving the great artificer's
design, there could be no such episodes of blundering
and perverse departure from the direct path as Adam
Smith finds in nearly all existing arrangements. Institutional
facts would then be "natural."[4] (2) When things
have gone wrong, they will right themselves if interference
with the natural course ceases; whereas, in the case
of a causal sequence simply, the mere cessation of interference
will not leave the outcome the same as if no
interference had taken place. This recuperative power of
nature is of an extra-mechanical character. The continuity
of sequence by force of which the natural course of
things prevails is, therefore, not of the nature of cause and
effect, since it bridges intervals and interruptions in the
causal sequence.[5] Adam Smith's use of the term "real"

[Footnote 4: The discrepancy between the actual, causally determined situation
and the divinely intended consummation is the metaphysical
ground of all that inculcation of morality and enlightened policy
that makes up so large a part of Adam Smith's work. The like,
of course, holds true for all moralists and reformers who proceed
on the assumption of a providential order.]

[Footnote 5: "In the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has]*
-----File: 125.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
in statements of theory--as, for example, "real value,"
"real price"[6]--is evidence to this effect. "Natural"
commonly has the same meaning as "real" in this connection.[7]
Both "natural" and "real" are placed in contrast
with the actual; and, in Adam Smith's apprehension,
both have a substantiality different from and superior to
facts. The view involves a distinction between reality
and fact, which survives in a weakened form in the
theories of "normal" prices, wages, profits, costs, in
Adam Smith's successors.

This animistic prepossession seems to pervade the earlier
of his two monumental works in a greater degree
than the later. In the <i>Moral Sentiments</i> recourse is had
to the teleological ground of the natural order more freely
and with perceptibly greater insistence. There seems to
be reason for holding that the animistic preconception
weakened or, at any rate, fell more into the background
as his later work of speculation and investigation proceeded.
The change shows itself also in some details of
his economic theory, as first set forth in the <i>Lectures</i>, and
afterwards more fully developed in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.
So, for instance, in the earlier presentation of the

*[Footnote: fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad
effects of the folly and injustice of man; in the same manner
as it has done in the natural body, for remedying those of his
sloth and intemperance." <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book IV, chap. ix.]

[Footnote 6: <i>E.g.</i>,"the real measure of the exchangeable value of all
commodities." <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, chap, v, and repeatedly
in the like connection.]

[Footnote 7: <i>E.g.</i>, Book I, chap. vii: "When the price of any commodity is
neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the
land, the wages of the labor, and the profits of the stock employed
in raising, preparing, and bringing it to market, according to their
<i>natural</i> rates, the commodity is then sold for what may be called
its <i>natural</i> price." "The actual price at which any commodity is
commonly sold is called its market price. It may be either above,
or below or exactly the same with its natural price."]
-----File: 126.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-------------
matter, "the division of labor is the immediate cause of
opulence"; and this division of labor, which is the chief
condition of economic well-being, "flows from a direct
propensity in human nature for one man to barter with
another."[8] The "propensity" in question is here appealed
to as a natural endowment immediately given to
man with a view to the welfare of human society, and
without any attempt at further explanation of how man
has come by it. No causal explanation of its presence or
character is offered. But the corresponding passage of
the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> handles the question more cautiously.[9]
Other parallel passages might be compared, with
much the same effect. The guiding hand has withdrawn
farther from the range of human vision.

However, these and other like filial expressions of a
devout optimism need, perhaps, not be taken as integral
features of Adam Smith's economic theory, or as seriously
affecting the character of his work as an economist.
They are the expression of his general philosophical and
theological views, and are significant for the present purpose
chiefly as evidences of an animistic and optimistic
bent. They go to show what is Adam Smith's accepted
ground of finality,--the ground to which all his speculations
on human affairs converge; but they do not in any

[Footnote 8: <i>Lectures of Adam Smith</i> (Ed. Cannan, 1896), p. 169.]

[Footnote 9: "This division of labor, from which so many advantages are
derived, is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which
foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion.
It is the necessary though very slow and gradual consequence
of a certain propensity in human nature which has in
view no such extensive utility,--the propensity to truck, barter,
and exchange one thing for another. Whether this propensity be
one of those original principles in human nature of which no
further account can be given, or whether, as seems more
probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of
reason and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire."
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, chap. ii.]
-----File: 127.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-
great degree show the teleological bias guiding his formulation
of economic theory in detail.

The effective working of the teleological bias is best
seen in Smith's more detailed handling of economic phenomena--in
his discussion of what may loosely be called
economic institutions--and in the criteria and principles
of procedure by which he is guided in incorporating these
features of economic life into the general structure of his
theory. A fair instance, though perhaps not the most
telling one, is the discussion of the "real and nominal
price," and of the "natural and market price" of commodities,
already referred to above.[10] The "real" price
of commodities is their value in terms of human life.
At this point Smith differs from the Physiocrats, with
whom the ultimate terms of value are afforded by human
sustenance taken as a product of the functioning of brute
nature; the cause of the difference being that the Physiocrats
conceived the natural order which works towards
the material well-being of man to comprise the non-human
environment only, whereas Adam Smith includes
man in this concept of the natural order, and, indeed,
makes him the central figure in the process of production.
With the Physiocrats, production is the work of nature:
with Adam Smith, it is the work of man and nature, with
man in the foreground. In Adam Smith, therefore, labor
is the final term in valuation. This "real" value of commodities
is the value imputed to them by the economist
under the stress of his teleological preconception. It has
little, if any, place in the course of economic events, and
no bearing on human affairs, apart from the sentimental
influence which such a preconception in favor of a "real

*actions. It is impossible to gauge this real value of
goods; it cannot be measured or expressed in concrete
terms. Still, if labor exchanges for a varying quantity of
goods, "it is their value which varies, not that of the
labor which purchases them."[11] The values which practically
attach to goods in men's handling of them are conceived
to be determined without regard to the real value
which Adam Smith imputes to the goods; but, for all that,
the substantial fact with respect to these market values is
their presumed approximation to the real values teleologically
imputed to the goods under the guidance of inviolate
natural laws. The real, or natural, value of articles has
no causal relation to the value at which they exchange.
The discussion of how values are determined in practice
runs on the motives of the buyers and sellers, and the relative
advantage enjoyed by the parties to the transaction.[12]
It is a discussion of a process of valuation, quite unrelated
to the "real," or "natural," price of things, and
quite unrelated to the grounds on which things are held
to come by their real, or natural, price; and yet, when the
complex process of valuation has been traced out in terms
of human motives and the exigencies of the market, Adam
Smith feels that he has only cleared the ground. He
then turns to the serious business of accounting for value
and price theoretically, and making the ascertained facts
articulate with his teleological theory of economic life.[13]

[Footnote 11: <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, chap. v.]

[Footnote 12: As, <i>e.g.</i>, the entire discussion of the determination of Wages,
Profits and Rent, in Book I, chaps, viii.-xi.]

[Footnote 13: "There is in every society or neighborhood an ordinary or
average rate both of wages and profit in every different employment
of labor and stock[** needs a full stop, not in original] This rate is naturally regulated, ...
partly by the general circumstances of the society.... There is,
likewise, in every society or neighborhood an ordinary or average
rate of rent, which is regulated, too.... These ordinary or
average rates may be called the natural rates of wages, profit,]*
-----File: 129.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-

The occurrence of the words "ordinary" and "average"
in this connection need not be taken too seriously.
The context makes it plain that the equality which commonly
subsists between the ordinary or average rates, and
the natural rates, is a matter of coincidence, not of identity.
Not only are there temporary deviations, but there
may be a permanent divergence between the ordinary and
the natural price of a commodity; as in case of a monopoly
or of produce grown under peculiar circumstances of
soil or climate.[14]

The natural price coincides with the price fixed by competition,
because competition means the unimpeded play
of those efficient forces through which the nicely adjusted
mechanism of nature works out the design to accomplish
which it was contrived. The natural price is reached
through the free interplay of the factors of production,
and it is itself an outcome of production. Nature, including
the human factor, works to turn out the goods; and
the natural value of the goods is their appraisement from
the standpoint of this productive process of nature. Natural
value is a category of production: whereas, notoriously
exchange value or market price is a category of
distribution. And Adam Smith's theoretical handling of
market price aims to show how the factors of human predilection
and human wants at work in the higgling of the

*[Footnote: and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.
When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than
what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the
labor, and the profits of the stock employed in raising, preparing,
and bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, the
commodity is then sold for what may be called its natural price."
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, chap. vii.]

[Footnote 14: "Such commodities may continue for whole centuries together
to be sold at this high price; and that part of it which
resolves itself into the rent of land is, in this case, the part
which is generally paid above its natural rate." Book I, chap. vii.]
-----File: 130.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-
market bring about a result in passable consonance with
the natural laws that are conceived to govern production.

The natural price is a composite result of the blending
of the three "component parts of the price of commodities,"--the
natural wages of laborer, the natural profits
of stock, and the natural rent of land; and each of these
three components is in its turn the measure of the productive
effect of the factor to which it pertains. The
further discussion of these shares in distribution aims to
account for the facts of distribution on the ground of the
productivity of the factors which are held to share the
product between them. That is to say, Adam Smith's
preconception of a productive natural process as the basis
of his economic theory dominates his aims and procedure,
when he comes to deal with phenomena that cannot be
stated in terms of production. The causal sequence in
the process of distribution is, by Adam Smith's own showing,
unrelated to the causal sequence in the process of
production; but, since the latter is the substantial fact, as
viewed from the standpoint of a teleological natural order,
the former must be stated in terms of the latter before
Adam Smith's sense of substantiality, or "reality," is
satisfied. Something of the same kind is, of course, visible
in the Physiocrats and in Cantillon. It amounts to an
extension of the natural-rights preconception to economic
theory. Adam Smith's discussion of distribution as a
function of productivity might be traced in detail through
his handling of Wages, Profits, and Rent; but, since the
aim here is a brief characterisation only, and not an exposition,
no farther pursuit of this point seems feasible.

It may, however, be worth while to point out another
line of influence along which the dominance of the teleological
preconception shows itself in Adam Smith. This
is the normalisation of data, in order to bring them into
-----File: 131.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\-
consonance with an orderly course of approach to the
putative natural end of economic life and development.
The result of this normalisation of data is, on the one
hand, the use of what James Steuart calls "conjectural
history" in dealing with past phases of economic life, and,
on the other hand, a statement of present-day phenomena
in terms of what legitimately ought to be according to the
God-given end of life rather than in terms of unconstrued
observation. Account is taken of the facts (supposed or
observed) ostensibly in terms of causal sequence, but the
imputed causal sequence is construed to run on lines of
teleological legitimacy.

A familiar instance of this "conjectural history," in a
highly and effectively normalized form, is the account of
"that early and rude state of society which precedes both
the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of
land."[15] It is needless at this day to point out that this
"early and rude state," in which "the whole produce of
labor belongs to the laborer," is altogether a figment. The
whole narrative, from the putative origin down, is not
only supposititious, but it is merely a schematic presentation
of what should have been the course of past development,
in order to lead up to that ideal economic situation
which would satisfy Adam Smith's preconception.[16] As
the narrative comes nearer the region of known latter-day
facts, the normalisation of the data becomes more difficult
and receives more detailed attention; but the change in
method is a change of degree rather than of kind. In the
"early and rude state" the coincidence of the "natural"
and the actual course of events is immediate and undis-*

appear, when not seen in the light of Adam Smith's preconception,

-----File: 132.png---\Pitirim\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
*turbed, there being no refractory data at hand; but in the
later stages and in the present situation, where refractory
facts abound, the co√∂rdination is difficult, and the coincidence
can be shown only by a free abstraction from phenomena
that are irrelevant to the teleological trend and
by a laborious interpretation of the rest. The facts of
modern life are intricate, and lend themselves to statement
in the terms of the theory only after they have been subjected
to a "higher criticism."

The chapter "Of the Origin and Use of Money"[17] is
an elegantly normalised account of the origin and nature
of an economic institution, and Adam Smith's further discussion
of money runs on the same lines. The origin of
money is stated in terms of the purpose which money
should legitimately serve in such a community as Adam
Smith considered right and good, not in terms of the
motives and exigencies which have resulted in the use of
money and in the gradual rise of the existing method of
payment and accounts. Money is "the great wheel of
circulation," which effects the transfer of goods in process
of production and the distribution of the finished
goods to the consumers. It is an organ of the economic
commonwealth rather than an expedient of accounting
and a conventional repository of wealth.

It is perhaps superfluous to remark that to the "plain
man," who is not concerned with the "natural course of
things" in a consummate <i>Geldwirtschaft</i>, the money that
passes his hand is not a "great wheel of circulation." To
the Samoyed, for instance, the reindeer which serves him
as unit of value is wealth in the most concrete and tangible
form. Much the same is true of coin, or even of
bank-notes, in the apprehension of unsophisticated people
among ourselves to-day. And yet it is in terms of the

[Footnote 17: Book I, chap. iv.]
-----File: 133.png---\Pitirim\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\---------
habits and conditions of life of these "plain people" that
the development of money will have to be accounted for
if it is to be stated in terms of cause and effect.

<tb>

The few scattered passages already cited may serve to
illustrate how Adam Smith's animistic or teleological bent
shapes the general structure of his theory and gives it
consistency. The principle of definitive formulation in
Adam Smith's economic knowledge is afforded by a putative
purpose that does not at any point enter causally into
the economic life process which he seeks to know. This
formative or normative purpose or end is not freely conceived
to enter as an efficient agent in the events discussed,
or to be in any way consciously present in the process.
It can scarcely be taken as an animistic agency engaged
in the process. It sanctions the course of things, and
gives legitimacy and substance to the sequence of events,
so far as this sequence may be made to square with the
requirements of the imputed end. It has therefore a
ceremonial or symbolical force only, and lends the discussion
a ceremonial competency; although with economists
who have been in passable agreement with Adam Smith as
regards the legitimate end of economic life this ceremonial
consistency, or consistency <i>de jure</i> has for many purposes
been accepted as the formulation of a causal continuity[** smudge, probably not a comma]
in the phenomena that have been interpreted in
its terms. Elucidations of what normally ought to happen,
as a matter of ceremonial necessity, have in this way
come to pass for an account of matters of fact.

But, as has already been pointed out, there is much more
to Adam Smith's exposition of theory than a formulation
of what ought to be. Much of the advance he achieved
over his predecessors consists in a larger and more painstaking
scrutiny of facts, and a more consistent tracing
-----File: 134.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------
out of causal continuity in the facts handled. No doubt,
his superiority over the Physiocrats, that characteristic of
his work by virtue of which it superseded theirs in the
farther growth of economic science, lies to some extent
in his recourse to a different, more modern ground of
normality,--a ground more in consonance with the body
of preconceptions that have had the vogue in later generations.
It is a shifting of the point of view from which the
facts are handled; but it comes in great part to a substitution
of a new body of preconceptions for the old, or a
new adaptation of the old ground of finality, rather than
an elimination of all metaphysical or animistic norms of
valuation. With Adam Smith, as with the Physiocrats,
the fundamental question, the answer to which affords the
point of departure and the norm of procedure, is a question
of substantiality or economic "reality." With both,
the answer to this question is given na√Øvely, as a deliverance
of common sense. Neither is disturbed by doubts as
to this deliverance of common sense or by any need of
scrutinising it. To the Physiocrats this substantial
ground of economic reality is the nutritive process of Nature.
To Adam Smith it is Labor. His reality has the
advantage of being the deliverance of the common sense of
a more modern community, and one that has maintained
itself in force more widely and in better consonance with
the facts of latter-day industry. The Physiocrats owe
their preconception of the productiveness of nature to the
habits of thought of a community in whose economic life
the dominant phenomenon was the owner of agricultural
land. Adam Smith owes his preconception in favor of
labor to a community in which the obtrusive economic
feature of the immediate past was handicraft and agriculture,
with commerce as a scarcely secondary phenomenon.
-----File: 135.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------

So far as Adam Smith's economic theories are a tracing
out of the causal sequence in economic phenomena, they
are worked out in terms given by these two main directions
of activity,--human effort directed to the shaping
of the material means of life, and human effort and discretion
directed to a pecuniary gain. The former is the
great, substantial productive force: the latter is not immediately,
or proximately, productive.[18] Adam Smith still
has too lively a sense of the nutritive purpose of the order
of nature freely to extend the concept of productiveness
to any activity that does not yield a material increase of
the creature comforts. His instinctive appreciation of the
substantial virtue of whatever effectually furthers nutrition,
even leads him into the concession that "in agriculture
nature labors along with man," although the general
tenor of his argument is that the productive force with
which the economist always has to count is human labor.
This recognised substantiality of labor as productive is,
as has already been remarked, accountable for his effort
to reduce to terms of productive labor such a category of
distribution as exchange value.

With but slight qualification, it will hold that, in the
causal sequence which Adam Smith traces out in his
economic theories proper (contained in the first three
books of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>), the causally efficient
factor is conceived to be human nature in these two relations,--of
productive efficiency and pecuniary gain
through exchange. Pecuniary gain--gain in the material
means of life through barter--furnishes the motive
force to the economic activity of the individual; although
productive efficiency is the legitimate, normal end of the
community's economic life. To such an extent does this

[Footnote 18: See <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book II, chap. v, "Of the Different
Employment of Capitals."]
-----File: 136.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------
concept of man's seeking his ends through "truck, barter,
and exchange" pervade Adam Smith's treatment of economic
processes that he even states production in its
terms, and says that "labor was the first price, the original
purchase-money, that was paid for all things."[19] The
human nature engaged in this pecuniary traffic is conceived
in somewhat hedonistic terms, and the motives and movements
of men are normalised to fit the requirements of a
hedonistically conceived order of nature. Men are very
much alike in their native aptitudes and propensities;[20]
and, so far as economic theory need take account of these
aptitudes and propensities, they are aptitudes for the production
of the "necessaries and conveniences of life,"
and propensities to secure as great a share of these creature
comforts as may be.

Adam Smith's conception of normal human nature--that
is to say, the human factor which enters causally in
the process which economic theory discusses--comes, on
the whole, to this: Men exert their force and skill in a
mechanical process of production, and their pecuniary
sagacity in a competitive process of distribution, with a
view to individual gain in the material means of life.
These material means are sought in order to the satisfaction
of men's natural wants through their consumption.
It is true, much else enters into men's endeavors in the
struggle for wealth, as Adam Smith points out; but this
consumption comprises the legitimate range of incentives,

[Footnote 19: <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book I, chap. v. See also the plea for
free trade, Book IV, chap. ii: "But the annual revenue of every
society is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the
whole annual produce of its industry, or, rather, is precisely the
same thing with that exchangeable value."]

[Footnote 20: "The difference of natural talents in different men is in
reality much less than we are aware of." <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
Book I, chap. ii.]
-----File: 137.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\aagam\cmspence\----------
and a theory which concerns itself with the natural course
of things need take but incidental account of what does
not come legitimately in the natural course. In point of
fact, there are appreciable "actual," though scarcely
"real," departures from this rule. They are spurious and
insubstantial departures, and do not properly come within
the purview of the stricter theory. And, since human nature
is strikingly uniform, in Adam Smith's apprehension,
both the efforts put forth and the consumptive effect
accomplished may be put in quantitative terms and treated
algebraically, with the result that the entire range of phenomena
comprised under the head of consumption need be
but incidentally considered; and the theory of production
and distribution is complete when the goods or the values
have been traced to their disappearance in the hands of
their ultimate owners. The reflex effect of consumption
upon production and distribution is, on the whole, quantitative
only.

Adam Smith's preconception of a normal teleological
order of procedure in the natural course, therefore, affects
not only those features of theory where he is avowedly
concerned with building up a normal scheme of the economic
process. Through his normalising the chief causal
factor engaged in the process, it affects also his arguments
from cause to effect.[21] What makes this latter feature

[Footnote 21: "Mit diesen philosophischen Ueberzeugungen tritt nun Adam
Smith an die Welt der Enfahrung heran, und es ergiebt sich ihm
die Richtigkeit der Principien. Der Reiz der Smith'schen
Schriften beruht zum grossen Teile darauf, dass Smith die Principien
in so innige Verbindung mit dem Thats√§chlichen gebracht.
Hie und da werden dann auch die Principien, was durch diese
Verbindung veranlasst wird, an ihren Spitzen etwas abgeschliffen,
ihre allzuscharfe Auspr√§gung dadurch vermieden. Nichtsdestoweniger
aber bleiben sie stets die leitenden Grundgedanken."

-----File: 138.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------
worth particular attention is the fact that his successors
carried this normalisation farther, and employed it with
less frequent reference to the mitigating exceptions which
Adam Smith notices by the way.

The reason for that farther and more consistent normalisation
of human nature which gives us the "economic
man" at the hands of Adam Smith's successors lies, in
great part, in the utilitarian philosophy that entered in
force and in consummate form at about the turning of the
century. Some credit in the work of normalisation is due
also to the farther supersession of handicraft by the "capitalistic"
industry that came in at the same time and in
pretty close relation with the utilitarian views.

<tb>

After Adam Smith's day, economics fell into profane
hands. Apart from Malthus, who, of all the greater
economists, stands nearest to Adam Smith on such metaphysical
heads as have an immediate bearing upon the
premises of economic science, the next generation do not
approach their subject from the point of view of a divinely
instituted order; nor do they discuss human interests
with that gently optimistic spirit of submission that
belongs to the economist who goes to his work with the
fear of God before his eyes. Even with Malthus the recourse
to the divinely sanctioned order of nature is somewhat
sparing and temperate. But it is significant for the
later course of economic theory that, while Malthus may
well be accounted the truest continuer of Adam Smith, it
was the undevout utilitarians that became the spokesmen
of the science after Adam Smith's time.

There is no wide breach between Adam Smith and the
utilitarians, either in details of doctrine or in the concrete
conclusions arrived at as regards questions of policy. On
-----File: 139.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------
these heads Adam Smith might well be classed as a moderate
utilitarian, particularly so far as regards his economic
work. Malthus has still more of a utilitarian air,--so
much so, indeed, that he is not infrequently spoken of
as a utilitarian. This view, convincingly set forth by
Mr. Bonar,[22] is no doubt well borne out by a detailed
scrutiny of Malthus's economic doctrines. His humanitarian
bias is evident throughout, and his weakness for
considerations of expediency is the great blemish of his
scientific work. But, for all that, in order to an appreciation[** accidentally a word or two omitted here?]
of the change that came over classical economics
with the rise of Benthamism, it is necessary to note that
the agreement in this matter between Adam Smith and
the disciples of Bentham, and less decidedly that between
Malthus and the latter, is a coincidence of conclusions
rather than an identity of preconceptions.[23]

With Adam Smith the ultimate ground of economic
reality is the design of God, the teleological order; and
his utilitarian generalisations, as well as the hedonistic
character of his economic man, are but methods of the
working out of this natural order, not the substantial and
self-legitimating ground. Shifty as Malthus's metaphysics
are, much the same is to be said for him.[24] Of the
utilitarians proper the converse is true, although here,
again, there is by no means utter consistency. The sub-*

[Footnote 22: See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Malthus and his Work</i>, especially Book III, as also
the chapter on Malthus in <i>Philosophy and Political Economy</i>,
Book III, Modern Philosophy: Utilitarian Economics, chap. i,
"Malthus."]

[Footnote 23: Ricardo is here taken as a utilitarian of the Benthamite
color, although he cannot be classed as a disciple of Bentham.
His hedonism is but the uncritically accepted metaphysics comprised
in the common sense of his time, and his substantial coincidence
with Bentham goes to show how well diffused the hedonist
preconception was at the time.]

[Footnote 24: <i>Cf.</i> Bonar, <i>Malthus and his Work</i>, pp. 323-336.]
-----File: 140.png---\skywrite\sourcejedi\macaw89\JackieB\cmspence\--------
*stantial economic ground is pleasure and pain: the teleological
order (even the design of God, where that is admitted)
is the method of its working-out.

It may be unnecessary here to go into the farther implications,
psychological and ethical, which this preconception
of the utilitarians involves. And even this much
may seem a taking of excessive pains with a distinction
that marks no tangible difference. But a reading of the
classical doctrines, with something of this metaphysics of
political economy in mind, will show how, and in great
part why, the later economists of the classical line diverged
from Adam Smith's tenets in the early years of
the century, until it has been necessary to interpret Adam
Smith somewhat shrewdly in order to save him from
heresy.

The post-Bentham economics is substantially a theory
of value. This is altogether the dominant feature of
the body of doctrines; the rest follows from, or is
adapted to, this central discipline. The doctrine of value
is of very great importance also in Adam Smith; but
Adam Smith's economics is a theory of the production
and apportionment of the material means of life.[25] With
Adam Smith, value is discussed from the point of view of
production. With the utilitarians, production is discussed
from the point of view of value. The former makes
value an outcome of the process of production: the latter
make production the outcome of a valuation process.

The point of departure with Adam Smith is the "productive
power of labor."[26] With Ricardo it is a pecuni-*

[Footnote 25: His work is an inquiry into "the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations."]

[Footnote 26: "The annual labor of every nation is the fund which
originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of
life which it annually consumes, and which consist always either
in the immediate produce of that labor or in what is purchased]*
-----File: 141.png---\Pitirim\sourcejedi\macaw89\aagam\cmspence\-----------
*ary problem concerned in the distribution of ownership;[27]
but the classical writers are followers of Adam Smith, and
improve upon and correct the results arrived at by him,
and the difference of point of view, therefore, becomes
evident in their divergence from him, and the different
distribution of emphasis, rather than in a new and antagonistic
departure.

The reason for this shifting of the center of gravity
from production to valuation lies, proximately, in Bentham's
revision of the "principles" of morals. Bentham's
philosophical position is, of course, not a self-explanatory
phenomenon, nor does the effect of Benthamism
extend only to those who are avowed followers of
Bentham; for Bentham is the exponent of a cultural
change that affects the habits of thought of the entire
community. The immediate point of Bentham's work, as
affecting the habits of thought of the educated community,
is the substitution of hedonism (utility) in place of
achievement of purpose, as a ground of legitimacy and a
guide in the normalisation of knowledge. Its effect is
most patent in speculations on morals, where it inculcates
determinism. Its close connection with determinism in
ethics points the way to what may be expected of its working
in economics. In both cases the result is that human
action is construed in terms of the causal forces of the
environment, the human agent being, at the best, taken as
a mechanism of commutation, through the workings of
which the sensuous effects wrought by the impinging

*[Footnote: with that produce from other nations." <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
"Introduction and Plan," opening paragraph.]

[Footnote 27: "The produce of the earth--all that is derived from its surface
by the united application of labor, machinery, and capital--is
divided among three classes of the community.... To determine
the laws which regulate this distribution, is the principal
problem of political economy." <i>Political Economy</i>, Preface.]
-----File: 142.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-
forces of the environment are, by an enforced process of
valuation, transmuted without quantitative discrepancy
into moral or economic conduct, as the case may be. In
ethics and economics alike the subject-matter of the theory
is this valuation process that expresses itself in conduct,
resulting, in the case of economic conduct, in the pursuit
of the greatest gain or least sacrifice.

Metaphysically or cosmologically considered, the human
nature into the motions of which hedonistic ethics
and economics inquire is an intermediate term in a causal
sequence, of which the initial and the terminal members
are sensuous impressions and the details of conduct.
This intermediate term conveys the sensuous impulse
without loss of force to its eventuation in conduct. For
the purpose of the valuation process through which the
impulse is so conveyed, human nature may, therefore, be
accepted as uniform; and the theory of the valuation
process may be formulated quantitatively, in terms of the
material forces affecting the human sensory and of their
equivalents in the resulting activity. In the language of
economics, the theory of value may be stated in terms of
the consumable goods that afford the incentive to effort
and the expenditure undergone in order to procure them.
Between these two there subsists a necessary equality;
but the magnitudes between which the equality subsists
are hedonistic magnitudes, not magnitudes of kinetic
energy nor of vital force, for the terms handled are sensuous
terms. It is true, since human nature is substantially
uniform, passive, and unalterable in respect of men's capacity
for sensuous affection, there may also be presumed
to subsist a substantial equality between the psychological
effect to be wrought by the consumption of goods, on
the one side, and the resulting expenditure of kinetic or
-----File: 143.png---\cajordan\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
vital force, on the other side; but such an equality is,
after all, of the nature of a coincidence, although there
should be a strong presumption in favor of its prevailing
on an average and in the common run of cases. Hedonism,
however, does not postulate uniformity between men
except in the respect of sensuous cause and effect.

The theory of value which hedonism gives is, therefore,
a theory of cost in terms of discomfort. By virtue
of the hedonistic equilibrium reached through the valuation
process, the sacrifice or expenditure of sensuous
reality involved in acquisition is the equivalent of the
sensuous gain secured. An alternative statement might
perhaps be made, to the effect that the measure of the
value of goods is not the sacrifice or discomfort undergone,
but the sensuous gain that accrues from the
acquisition of the goods; but this is plainly only an
alternative statement, and there are special reasons in
the economic life of the time why the statement in terms
of cost, rather than in terms of "utility," should commend
itself to the earlier classical economists.

On comparing the utilitarian doctrine of value with
earlier theories, then, the case stands somewhat as follows.
The Physiocrats and Adam Smith contemplate value as
a measure of the productive force that realises itself in
the valuable article. With the Physiocrats this productive
force is the "anabolism" of Nature (to resort to
a physiological term): with Adam Smith it is chiefly
human labor directed to heightening the serviceability of
the materials with which it is occupied. Production
causes value in either case. The post-Bentham economics
contemplates value as a measure of, or as measured by,
the irksomeness of the effort involved in procuring the
valuable goods. As Mr. E. C. K. Gonner has admirably
-----File: 144.png---\cajordan\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
pointed out,[28] Ricardo--and the like holds true of classical
economics generally--makes cost the foundation of
value, not its cause. This resting of value on cost takes
place through a valuation. Any one who will read Adam
Smith's theoretical exposition to as good purpose as Mr.
Gonner has read Ricardo will scarcely fail to find that
the converse is true in Adam Smith's case. But the
causal relation of cost to value holds only as regards
"natural" or "real" value in Adam Smith's doctrine.
As regards market price, Adam Smith's theory does not
differ greatly from that of Ricardo on this head. He does
not overlook the valuation process by which market price
is adjusted and the course of investment is guided, and
his discussion of this process runs in terms that should be
acceptable to any hedonist.

<tb>

The shifting of the point of view that comes into economics
with the acceptance of utilitarian ethics and its
correlate, the associationist psychology, is in great part a
shifting to the ground of causal sequence as contrasted
with that of serviceability to a preconceived end. This
is indicated even by the main fact already cited,--that
the utilitarian economists make exchange value the central
feature of their theories, rather than the conduciveness
of industry to the community's material welfare.
Hedonistic exchange value is the outcome of a valuation
process enforced by the apprehended pleasure-giving
capacities of the items valued. And in the utilitarian
theories of production, arrived at from the standpoint so
given by exchange value, the conduciveness to welfare is
not the objective point of the argument. This objective
point is rather the bearing of productive enterprise upon

[Footnote 28: In the introductory essay to his edition of Ricardo's <i>Political
Economy</i>. See, <i>e.g.</i>, paragraphs 9 and 24.]
-----File: 145.png---\cajordan\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
the individual fortunes of the agents engaged, or upon
the fortunes of the several distinguishable classes of
beneficiaries comprised in the industrial community; for
the great immediate bearing of exchange values upon the
life of the collectivity is their bearing upon the distribution
of wealth. Value is a category of distribution. The
result is that, as is well shown by Mr. Cannan's discussion,[29]
the theories of production offered by the classical
economists have been sensibly scant, and have been carried
out with a constant view to the doctrines on distribution.
An incidental but telling demonstration of
the same facts is given, by Professor B√ºcher;[30] and in
illustration may be cited Torrens's <i>Essay on the Production
of Wealth</i>, which is to a good extent occupied with
discussions of value and distribution. The classical
theories of production have been theories of the production
of "wealth"; and "wealth," in classical usage,
consists of material things having exchange value. During
the vogue of the classical economics the accepted
characteristic by which "wealth" has been defined has
been its amenability to ownership. Neither in Adam
Smith nor in the Physiocrats is this amenability to ownership
made so much of, nor is it in a similar degree
accepted as a definite mark of the subject-matter of the
science.

As their hedonistic preconception would require, then,
it is to the pecuniary side of life that the classical economists
give their most serious attention, and it is the
pecuniary bearing of any given phenomenon or of any
institution that commonly shapes the issue of the argument.
The causal sequence about which the discussion

[Footnote 29: <i>Theories of Production and Distribution</i>, 1776-1848.]

[Footnote 30: <i>Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft</i> (second edition). <i>Cf.</i>
especially chaps. ii, iii, vi, and vii.]
-----File: 146.png---\bibliothekarin\griff4\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\--------
centers is a process of pecuniary valuation. It runs on
distribution, ownership, acquisition, gain, investment, exchange.[31]
In this way the doctrines on production come
to take a pecuniary coloring; as is seen in a less degree
also in Adam Smith, and even in the Physiocrats,
although these earlier economists very rarely, if ever, lose
touch with the concept of generic serviceability as the
characteristic feature of production. The tradition derived
from Adam Smith, which made productivity and
serviceability the substantial features of economic life,
was not abruptly put aside by his successors, though the
emphasis was differently distributed by them in following
out the line of investigation to which the tradition pointed
the way. In the classical economics the ideas of production
and of acquisition are not commonly held apart, and
very much of what passes for a theory of production is
occupied with phenomena of investment and acquisition.
Torrens's <i>Essay</i> is a case in point, though by no means an
extreme case.

This is as it should be; for to the consistent hedonist
the sole motive force concerned in the industrial process
is the self-regarding motive of pecuniary gain, and industrial
activity is but an intermediate term between the
expenditure or discomfort undergone and the pecuniary
gain sought. Whether the end and outcome is an invidious
gain for the individual (in contrast with or at the
cost of his neighbors), or an enhancement of the facility
of human life on the whole, is altogether a by-question in

[Footnote 31: "Even if we put aside all questions which involve a consideration
of the effects of industrial institutions in modifying the
habits and character of the classes of the community, ... that
enough still remains to constitute a separate science, the mere
enumeration of the chief terms of economics--wealth, value,
exchange, credit, money, capital, and commodity--will suffice to
show." Shirres, <i>Analysis of the Ideas of Economics</i> (London,
1893), pp. 8 and 9.]
-----File: 147.png---\skywrite\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
any discussion of the range of incentives by which men
are prompted to their work or the direction which their
efforts take. The serviceability of the given line of activity,
for the life purposes of the community or for one's
neighbors, "is not of the essence of this contract." These
features of serviceability come into the account chiefly as
affecting the vendibility of what the given individual has
to offer in seeking gain through a bargain.[32]

In hedonistic theory the substantial end of economic
life is individual gain; and for this purpose production
and acquisition may be taken as fairly coincident, if not
identical. Moreover, society, in the utilitarian philosophy,
is the algebraic sum of the individuals; and the interest
of the society is the sum of the interests of the
individuals. It follows by easy consequence, whether
strictly true or not, that the sum of individual gains is
the gain of the society, and that, in serving his own interest
in the way of acquisition, the individual serves the
collective interest of the community. Productivity or
serviceability is, therefore, to be presumed of any occupation
or enterprise that looks to a pecuniary gain; and so,
by a roundabout path, we get back to the ancient conclusion
of Adam Smith, that the remuneration of classes or
persons engaged in industry coincides with their productive
contribution to the output of services and consumable
goods.

A felicitous illustration of the working of this hedonistic
norm in classical economic doctrine is afforded by
the theory of the wages of superintendence,--an element
in distribution which is not much more than suggested in

[Footnote 32: "If a commodity were in no way useful, ... it would be
destitute of exchangeable value; ... (but), possessing utility,
commodities derive their exchangeable value from two sources,"
etc. Ricardo, <i>Political Economy</i>, chap, i, sect. I.]
-----File: 148.png---\skywrite\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
Adam Smith, but which receives ampler and more painstaking
attention as the classical body of doctrines reaches
a fuller development. The "wages of superintendence"
are the gains due to pecuniary management. They are
the gains that come to the director of the "business,"--not
those that go to the director of the mechanical process
or to the foreman of the shop. The latter are wages
simply. This distinction is not altogether clear in the
earlier writers, but it is clearly enough contained in the
fuller development of the theory.

The undertaker's work is the management of investment.
It is altogether of a pecuniary character, and its
proximate aim is "the main chance." If it leads, indirectly,
to an enhancement of serviceability or a heightened
aggregate output of consumable goods, that is a
fortuitous circumstance incident to that heightened vendibility
on which the investor's gain depends. Yet the
classical doctrine says frankly that the wages of superintendence
are the remuneration of superior productivity,[33]
and the classical theory of production is in good part a
doctrine of investment in which the identity of production
and pecuniary gain is taken for granted.

The substitution of investment in the place of industry
as the central and substantial fact in the process of production
is due not to the acceptance of hedonism simply,
but rather to the conjunction of hedonism with an economic
situation of which the investment of capital and

[Footnote 33: <i>Cf.</i>, for instance, Senior, <i>Political Economy</i> (London, 1872),
particularly pp. 88, 89, and 130-135, where the wages of superintendence
are, somewhat reluctantly, classed under profits; and
the work of superintendence is thereupon conceived as being,
immediately or remotely, an exercise of "abstinence" and a productive
work. The illustration of the bill-broker is particularly
apt. The like view of the wages of superintendence is an article
of theory with more than one of the later descendants of the
classical line.]
-----File: 149.png---\skywrite\natdp\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\---------------
its management for gain was the most obvious feature.
The situation which shaped the common-sense apprehension
of economic facts at the time was what has since been
called a capitalistic system, in which pecuniary enterprise
and the phenomena of the market were the dominant and
tone-giving facts. But this economic situation was also
the chief ground for the vogue of hedonism in economics;
so that hedonistic economics may be taken as an interpretation
of human nature in terms of the market-place.
The market and the "business world," to which the business
man in his pursuit of gain was required to adapt his
motives, had by this time grown so large that the course
of business events was beyond the control of any one
person; and at the same time those far-reaching organisations
of invested wealth which have latterly come to
prevail and to coerce the market were not then in the
foreground. The course of market events took its passionless
way without traceable relation or deference to
any man's convenience and without traceable guidance
towards an ulterior end. Man's part in this pecuniary
world was to respond with alacrity to the situation, and
so adapt his vendible effects to the shifting demand as to
realise something in the outcome. What he gained in
his traffic was gained without loss to those with whom he
dealt, for they paid no more than the goods were worth
to them. One man's gain need not be another's loss;
and, if it is not, then it is net gain to the community.

Among the striking remoter effects of the hedonistic
preconception, and its working out in terms of pecuniary
gain, is the classical failure to discriminate between capital
as investment and capital as industrial appliances. This
is, of course, closely related to the point already spoken
of. The appliances of industry further the production of
goods, therefore capital (invested wealth) is productive;
-----File: 150.png---\skywrite\natdp\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
and the rate of its average remuneration marks the degree
of its productiveness.[34] The most obvious fact limiting
the pecuniary gain secured by means of invested
wealth is the sum invested. Therefore, capital limits the
productiveness of industry; and the chief and indispensable
condition to an advance in material well-being is
the accumulation of invested wealth. In discussing the
conditions of industrial improvement, it is usual to assume
that "the state of the arts remains unchanged," which is,
for all purposes but that of a doctrine of profits per cent.,
an exclusion of the main fact. Investments may, further,
be transferred from one enterprise to another. Therefore,
and in that degree, the means of production are
"mobile."

<tb>

Under the hands of the great utilitarian writers, therefore,
political economy is developed into a science of
wealth, taking that term in the pecuniary sense, as things
amenable to ownership. The course of things in economic
life is treated as a sequence of pecuniary events,
and economic theory becomes a theory of what should
happen in that consummate situation where the permutation
of pecuniary magnitudes takes place without disturbance
and without retardation. In this consummate
situation the pecuniary motive has its perfect work, and
guides all the acts of economic man in a guileless, colorless,
unswerving quest of the greatest gain at the least
sacrifice. Of course, this perfect competitive system,
with its untainted "economic man," is a feat of the scientific
imagination, and is not intended as a competent expression
of fact. It is an expedient of abstract reasoning;

[Footnote 34: <i>Cf.</i> B√∂hm-Bawerk, <i>Capital and Interest</i>, Books II and IV, as
well as the Introduction and chaps. iv and v of Book I. B√∂hm-Bawerk's
discussion bears less immediately on the present point
than the similarity of the terms employed would suggest.]
-----File: 151.png---\skywrite\natdp\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
and its avowed competency extends only to the abstract
principles, the fundamental laws of the science, which
hold only so far as the abstraction holds. But, as happens
in such cases, having once been accepted and assimilated
as real, though perhaps not as actual, it becomes an effective
constituent in the inquirer's habits of thought, and
goes to shape his knowledge of facts. It comes to serve
as a norm of substantiality or legitimacy; and facts in
some degree fall under its constraint, as is exemplified by
many allegations regarding the "tendency" of things.

To this consummation, which Senior speaks of as "the
natural state of man,"[35] human development tends by
force of the hedonistic character of human nature; and in
terms of its approximation to this natural state, therefore,
the immature actual situation had best be stated. The
pure theory, the "hypothetical science" of Cairnes,
"traces the phenomena of the production and distribution
of wealth up to their causes, in the principles of human
nature and the laws and events--physical, political, and
social--of the external world."[36] But since the principles
of human nature that give the outcome in men's
economic conduct, so far as it touches the production and
distribution of wealth, are but the simple and constant
sequence of hedonistic cause and effect, the element of
human nature may fairly be eliminated from the problem,
with great gain in simplicity and expedition. Human
nature being eliminated, as being a constant intermediate
term, and all institutional features of the situation being
also eliminated (as being similar constants under that
natural or consummate pecuniary <i>r√©gime</i> with which the

[Footnote 35: <i>Political Economy</i>, p. 87.]

[Footnote 36: <i>Character and Logical Method of Political Economy</i> (New
York, 1875), p. 71. Cairnes may not be altogether representative
of the high tide of classicism, but his characterisation of
the science is none the less to the point.]
-----File: 152.png---\LRS\natdp\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\--------------------
pure theory is concerned), the laws of the phenomena of
wealth may be formulated in terms of the remaining factors.
These factors are the vendible items that men
handle in these processes of production and distribution;
and economic laws come, therefore, to be expressions of
the algebraic relations subsisting between the various elements
of wealth and investment,--capital, labor, land,
supply and demand of one and the other, profits, interest,
wages. Even such items as credit and population become
dissociated from the personal factor, and figure in the
computation as elemental factors acting and reacting
though a permutation of values over the heads of the good
people whose welfare they are working out.

<tb>

To sum up: the classical economics, having primarily
to do with the pecuniary side of life, is a theory of a
process of valuation. But since the human nature at
whose hands and for whose behoof the valuation takes
place is simple and constant in its reaction to pecuniary
stimulus, and since no other feature of human nature is
legitimately present in economic phenomena than this reaction
to pecuniary stimulus, the valuer concerned in the
matter is to be overlooked or eliminated; and the theory
of the valuation process then becomes a theory of the
pecuniary interaction of the facts valued. It is a theory
of valuation with the element of valuation left out,--a
theory of life stated in terms of the normal paraphernalia
of life.

In the preconceptions with which classical economics
set out were comprised the remnants of natural rights
and of the order of nature, infused with that peculiarly
mechanical natural theology that made its way into popular
vogue on British ground during the eighteenth century
and was reduced to a neutral tone by the British
-----File: 153.png---\LRS\natdp\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
penchant for the commonplace--stronger at this time
than at any earlier period. The reason for this growing
penchant for the commonplace, for the explanation of
things in causal terms, lies partly in the growing resort
to mechanical processes and mechanical prime movers in
industry, partly in the (consequent) continued decline of
the aristocracy and the priesthood, and partly in the growing
density of population and the consequent greater specialisation
and wider organisation of trade and business.
The spread of the discipline of the natural sciences,
largely incident to the mechanical industry, counts in the
same direction; and obscurer factors in modern culture
may have had their share.

The animistic preconception was not lost, but it lost
tone; and it partly fell into abeyance, particularly so far
as regards its avowal. It is visible chiefly in the unavowed
readiness of the classical writers to accept as
imminent and definitive any possible outcome which the
writer's habit or temperament inclined him to accept as
right and good. Hence the visible inclination of classical
economists to a doctrine of the harmony of interests, and
their somewhat uncircumspect readiness to state their
generalisations in terms of what ought to happen according
to the ideal requirements of that consummate <i>Geldwirtschaft</i>
to which men "are impelled by the provisions
of nature."[37] By virtue of their hedonistic preconceptions,
their habituation to the ways of a pecuniary culture,
and their unavowed animistic faith that nature is in the
right, the classical economists knew that the consummation
to which, in the nature of things, all things tend, is
the frictionless and beneficent competitive system. This
competitive ideal, therefore, affords the normal, and conformity
to its requirements affords the test of absolute

[Footnote 37: Senior, <i>Political Economy</i>, p. 87.]
-----File: 154.png---\LRS\natdp\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
economic truth. The standpoint so gained selectively
guides the attention of the classical writers in their observation
and apprehension of facts, and they come to see
evidence of conformity or approach to the normal in the
most unlikely places. Their observation is, in great part,
interpretative, as observation commonly is. What is peculiar
to the classical economists in this respect is their
particular norm of procedure in the work of interpretation.
And, by virtue of having achieved a standpoint of
absolute economic normality, they became a "deductive"
school, so called, in spite of the patent fact that they were
pretty consistently employed with an inquiry into the
causal sequence of economic phenomena.

The generalisation of observed facts becomes a normalisation
of them, a statement of the phenomena in terms of
their coincidence with, or divergence from, that normal
tendency that makes for the actualisation of the absolute
economic reality. This absolute or definitive ground of
economic legitimacy lies beyond the causal sequence in
which the observed phenomena are conceived to be interlinked.
It is related to the concrete facts neither as cause
nor as effect in any such way that the causal relation may
be traced in a concrete instance.[**P1: flyspeck] It has little causally
to do either with the "mental" or with the "physical"
data with which the classical economist is avowedly employed.
Its relation to the process under discussion is
that of an extraneous--that is to say, a ceremonial--legitimation.
The body of knowledge gained by its help
and under its guidance is, therefore, a taxonomic science.

So, by way of a concluding illustration, it may be
pointed out that money, for instance, is normalised in
terms of the legitimate economic tendency. It becomes
a measure of value and a medium of exchange. It has
become primarily an instrument of pecuniary commuta-*
-----File: 155.png---\LRS\natdp\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
*tion, instead of being, as under the earlier normalisation
of Adam Smith, primarily a great wheel of circulation for
the diffusion of consumable goods. The terms in which
the laws of money, as of the other phenomena of pecuniary
life, are formulated, are terms which connote its normal
function in the life history of objective values as they
live and move and have their being in the consummate
pecuniary situation of the "natural" state. To a similar
work of normalisation we owe those creatures of the
myth-maker, the quantity theory and the wages-fund.

THE PRECONCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC
SCIENCE[1]

III


In what has already been said, it has appeared that the
changes which have supervened in the preconceptions of
the earlier economists constitute a somewhat orderly succession.
The feature of chief interest in this development
has been a gradual change in the received grounds of
finality to which the successive generations of economists
have brought their theoretical output, on which they have
been content to rest their conclusions, and beyond which
they have not been moved to push their analysis of events
or their scrutiny of phenomena. There has been a fairly
unbroken sequence of development in what may be called
the canons of economic reality; or, to put it in other
words, there has been a precession of the point of view
from which facts have been handled and valued for the
purpose of economic science.

The notion which has in its time prevailed so widely,
that there is in the sequence of events a consistent trend
which it is the office of the science to ascertain and turn
to account,--this notion may be well founded or not.
But that there is something of such a consistent trend in
the sequence of the canons of knowledge under whose
guidance the scientist works is not only a generalisation
from the past course of things, but lies in the nature of
the case; for the canons of knowledge are of the nature

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly Journal of
Economics</i>. Vol. XIV, Feb., 1900.]
-----File: 157.png---\tigerswim\sourcejedi\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\--------
of habits of thought, and habit does not break with the
past, nor do the hereditary aptitudes that find expression
in habit vary gratuitously with the mere lapse of time.
What is true in this respect, for instance, in the domain
of law and institutions is true, likewise, in the domain of
science. What men have learned to accept as good and
definitive for the guidance of conduct and of human relations
remains true and definitive and unimpeachable until
the exigencies of a later, altered situation enforce a variation
from the norms and canons of the past, and so give
rise to a modification of the habits of thought that decide
what is, for the time, right in human conduct. So in
science the ancient ground of finality remains a good and
valid test of scientific truth until the altered exigencies
of later life enforce habits of thought that are not wholly
in consonance with the received notions as to what constitutes
the ultimate, self-legitimating term--the substantial
reality--to which knowledge in any given case must
penetrate.

This ultimate term or ground of knowledge is always
of a metaphysical character. It is something in the way
of a preconception, accepted uncritically, but applied in
criticism and demonstration of all else with which the
science is concerned. So soon as it comes to be criticised,
it is in a way to be superseded by a new, more or less
altered formulation; for criticism of it means that it is no
longer fit to survive unaltered in the altered complex of
habits of thought to which it is called upon to serve as
fundamental principle. It is subject to natural selection
and selective adaptation, as are other conventions. The
underlying metaphysics of scientific research and purpose,
therefore, changes gradually and, of course, incompletely,
much as is the case with the metaphysics underlying the
common law and the schedule of civil rights. As in the
-----File: 158.png---\tigerswim\rathindg@gmail.com\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-
legal framework the now avowedly useless and meaningless
preconceptions of status and caste and precedent are
even yet at the most metamorphosed and obsolescent
rather than overpassed,--witness the facts of inheritance,
vested interests, the outlawry of debts through lapse of
time, the competence of the State to coerce individuals
into support of a given policy,--so in the science the living
generation has not seen an abrupt and traceless disappearance
of the metaphysics that fixed the point of
view of the early classical political economy. This is true
even for those groups of economists who have most incontinently
protested against the absurdity of the classical
doctrines and methods. In Professor Marshall's words,
"There has been no real breach of continuity in the development
of the science."

But, while there has been no breach, there has none the
less been change,--more far-reaching change than some
of us are glad to recognise; for who would not be glad to
read his own modern views into the convincing words of
the great masters?

Seen through modern eyes and without effort to turn
past gains to modern account, the metaphysical or preconceptional
furniture of political economy as it stood about
the middle of this century may come to look quite curious.
The two main canons of truth on which the science proceeded,
and with which the inquiry is here concerned,
were: (<i>a</i>) a hedonistic-associational psychology, and (<i>b</i>)
an uncritical conviction that there is a meliorative trend
in the course of events, apart from the conscious ends of
the individual members of the community. This axiom
of a meliorative developmental trend fell into shape as a
belief in an organic or quasi-organic (physiological)[2] life

[Footnote 2: So, <i>e.g.</i>, Roscher, Comte, the early socialists, J. S. Mill, and
later Spencer, Schaeffle, Wagner.]
-----File: 159.png---\tigerswim\rathindg@gmail.com\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\-
process on the part of the economic community or of the
nation; and this belief carried with it something of a constraining
sense of self-realising cycles of growth, maturity
and decay in the life history of nations or communities.

Neglecting what may for the immediate purpose be
negligible in this outline of fundamental tenets, it will
bear the following construction. (<i>a</i>) On the ground of
the hedonistic or associational psychology, all spiritual
continuity and any consequent teleological trend is tacitly
denied so far as regards individual conduct, where the
later psychology, and the sciences which build on this
later psychology, insist upon and find such a teleological
trend at every turn. (<i>b</i>) Such a spiritual or quasi-spiritual
continuity and teleological trend is uncritically
affirmed as regards the non-human sequence or the sequence
of events in the affairs of collective life, where
the modern sciences diligently assert that nothing of the
kind is discernible, or that, if it is discernible, its recognition
is beside the point, so far as concerns the purposes
of the science.

This position, here outlined with as little qualification
as may be admissible, embodies the general metaphysical
ground of that classical political economy that
affords the point of departure for Mill and Cairnes,
and also for Jevons. And what is to be said of Mill
and Cairnes in this connection will apply to the later
course of the science, though with a gradually lessening
force.

By the middle of the century the psychological premises
of the science are no longer so neat and succinct as they
were in the days of Bentham and James Mill. At J. S.
Mill's hands, for instance, the na√Øvely quantitative hedonism
of Bentham is being supplanted by a sophisticated
-----File: 160.png---\tigerswim\rathindg@gmail.com\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-
hedonism, which makes much of an assumed qualitative
divergence between the different kinds of pleasures that
afford the motives of conduct. This revision of hedonistic
dogma, of course, means a departure from the strict
hedonistic ground. Correlated with this advance more
closely in the substance of the change than in the assignable
dates, is a concomitant improvement--at least, set
forth as an improvement--upon the received associational
psychology, whereby "similarity" is brought in to
supplement "contiguity" as a ground of connection between
ideas. This change is well shown in the work of
J. S. Mill and Bain. In spite of all the ingenuity spent in
maintaining the associational legitimacy of this new article
of theory, it remains a patent innovation and a departure
from the ancient standpoint. As is true of the improved
hedonism, so it is true of the new theory of association
that it is no longer able to construe the process which it
discusses as a purely mechanical process, a concatenation
of items simply. Similarity of impressions implies a comparison
of impressions by the mind in which the association
takes place, and thereby it implies some degree of
constructive work on the part of the perceiving subject.
The perceiver is thereby construed to be an agent in the
work of perception; therefore, he must be possessed of a
point of view and an end dominating the perceptive process.
To perceive the similarity, he must be guided by an
interest in the outcome, and must "attend." The like applies
to the introduction of qualitative distinctions into the
hedonistic theory of conduct. Apperception in the one
case and discretion in the other cease to be the mere registration
of a simple and personally uncolored sequence of
permutations enforced by the factors of the external
world. There is implied a spiritual--that is to say, active--"teleological"
continuity of process on the part of
-----File: 161.png---\tigerswim\rathindg@gmail.com\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-
the perceiving or of the discretionary agent, as the case
may be.

It is on the ground of their departure from the stricter
hedonistic premises that Mill and, after him, Cairnes are
able, for instance, to offer their improvement upon the
earlier doctrine of cost of production as determining
value. Since it is conceived that the motives which guide
men in their choice of employments and of domicile differ
from man to man and from class to class, not only in degree,
but in kind, and since varying antecedents, of heredity
and of habit, variously influence men in their choice of
a manner of life, therefore the mere quantitative pecuniary
stimulus cannot be depended on to decide the outcome
without recourse. There are determinable variations in
the alacrity with which different classes or communities
respond to the pecuniary stimulus; and in so far as this
condition prevails, the classes or communities in question
are non-competing. Between such non-competing groups
the norm that determines values is not the unmitigated
norm of cost of production taken absolutely, but only
taken relatively. The formula of cost of production is
therefore modified into a formula of reciprocal demand.
This revision of the cost-of-production doctrine is extended
only sparingly, and the emphasis is thrown on
the pecuniary circumstances on which depend the formation
and maintenance of non-competing groups. Consistency
with the earlier teaching is carefully maintained, so
far as may be; but extra-pecuniary factors are, after all,
even if reluctantly, admitted into the body of the theory.
So also, since there are higher and lower motives, higher
and lower pleasures,--as well as motives differing in degree,--it
follows that an unguided response even to the
mere quantitative pecuniary stimuli may take different
directions, and so may result in activities of widely differ-*
-----File: 162.png---\tigerswim\griff4\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
*ing outcome. Since activities set up in this way through
appeal to higher and lower motives are no longer conceived
to represent simply a mechanically adequate effect
of the stimuli, working under the control of natural laws
that tend to one beneficent consummation, therefore the
outcome of activity set up even by the normal pecuniary
stimuli may take a form that may or may not be serviceable
to the community. Hence <i>laissez-faire</i> ceases to be
a sure remedy for the ills of society. Human interests
are still conceived normally to be at one; but the detail
of individual conduct need not, therefore, necessarily serve
these generic human interests.[3] Therefore, other inducements
than the unmitigated impact of pecuniary exigencies
may be necessary to bring about a coincidence of class
or individual endeavor with the interests of the community.
It becomes incumbent on the advocate of <i>laissez-faire</i>
to "prove his minor premise." It is no longer self-evident
that: "Interests left to themselves tend to harmonious
combinations, and to the progressive preponderance
of the general good."[4]

The natural-rights preconception begins to fall away as
soon as the hedonistic mechanics have been seriously tampered
with. Fact and right cease to coincide, because the
individual in whom the rights are conceived to inhere has

[Footnote 3: "Let us not confound the statement that <i>human</i> interests are
at one with the statement that <i>class</i> interests are at one. The
latter I believe to be as false as the former is true.... But
accepting the major premises of the syllogism, that the interests
of human beings are fundamentally the same, how as to the
minor?--how as to the assumption that people know their
interests in the sense in which they are identical with the interests
of others, and that they spontaneously follow them <i>in this
sense</i>?"--Cairnes, Essays in Political Economy (London, 1873),
p. 245. This question cannot consistently be asked by an adherent
of the stricter hedonism.]

[Footnote 4: Bastiat, quoted by Cairnes, <i>Essays</i>, p. 319.]
-----File: 163.png---\Emeraldblue\diogenespc\gst\aagam\Hermit00\-----------
come to be something more than the field of intersection
of natural forces that work out in human conduct. The
mechanics of natural liberty--that assumed constitution
of things by force of which the free hedonistic play of
the laws of nature across the open field of individual
choice is sure to reach the right outcome--is the hedonistic
psychology; and the passing of the doctrine of natural
rights and natural liberty, whether as a premise or
as a dogma, therefore coincides with the passing of that
mechanics of conduct on the validity of which the theoretical
acceptance of the dogma depends. It is, therefore,
something more than a coincidence that the half-century
which has seen the disintegration of the hedonistic faith
and of the associational psychology has also seen the dissipation,
in scientific speculations, of the concomitant faith
in natural rights and in that benign order of nature of
which the natural-rights dogma is a corollary.

It is, of course, not hereby intended to say that the
later psychological views and premises imply a less close
dependence of conduct on environment than do the earlier
ones. Indeed, the reverse may well be held to be true.
The pervading characteristic of later thinking is the constant
recourse to a detailed analysis of phenomena in
causal terms. The modern catchword, in the present connection,
is "response to stimulus"; but the manner in
which this response is conceived has changed. The fact,
and ultimately the amplitude, at least in great part, of the
reaction to stimulus, is conditioned by the forces in impact;
but the constitution of the organism, as well as its
attitude at the moment of impact, in great part decides
what will serve as a stimulus, as well as what the manner
and direction of the response will be.

The later psychology is biological, as contrasted with
the metaphysical psychology of hedonism. It does not
-----File: 164.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
conceive the organism as a causal hiatus. The causal
sequence in the "reflex arc" is, no doubt, continuous;
but the continuity is not, as formerly, conceived in terms
of spiritual substance transmitting a shock: it is conceived
in terms of the life activity of the organism. Human
conduct, taken as the reaction of such an organism under
stimulus, may be stated in terms of tropism, involving, of
course, a very close-knit causal sequence between the
impact and the response, but at the same time imputing
to the organism a habit of life and a self-directing and
selective attention in meeting the complex of forces that
make up its environment. The selective play of this tropismatic
complex that constitutes the organism's habit of
life under the impact of the forces of the environment
counts as discretion.

So far, therefore, as it is to be placed in contrast with
the hedonistic phase of the older psychological doctrines,
the characteristic feature of the newer conception is the
recognition of a selectively self-directing life process in
the agent. While hedonism seeks the causal determinant
of conduct in the (probable) outcome of action, the later
conception seeks this determinant in the complex of propensities
that constitutes man a functioning agent, that is
to say, a personality. Instead of pleasure ultimately
determining what human conduct shall be, the tropismatic
propensities that eventuate in conduct ultimately determine
what shall be pleasurable. For the purpose in hand,
the consequence of the transition to the altered conception
of human nature and its relation to the environment is
that the newer view formulates conduct in terms of personality,
whereas the earlier view was content to formulate
it in terms of its provocation and its by-product.
Therefore, for the sake of brevity, the older preconceptions
of the science are here spoken of as construing
-----File: 165.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
human nature in inert terms, as contrasted with the newer,
which construes it in terms of functioning.

It has already appeared above that the second great
article of the metaphysics of classical political economy--the
belief in a meliorative trend or a benign order of
nature--is closely connected with the hedonistic conception
of human nature; but this connection is more intimate
and organic than appears from what has been said above.
The two are so related as to stand or fall together, for the
latter is but the obverse of the former. The doctrine of a
trend in events imputes purpose to the sequence of events;
that is, it invests this sequence with a discretionary, teleological
character, which asserts itself in a constraint over
all the steps in the sequence by which the supposed objective
point is reached. But discretion touching a given
end must be single, and must alone cover all the acts by
which the end is to be reached. Therefore, no discretion
resides in the intermediate terms through which the end is
worked out. Therefore, man being such an intermediate
term, discretion cannot be imputed to him without violating
the supposition. Therefore, given an indefeasible
meliorative trend in events, man is but a mechanical intermediary
in the sequence. It is as such a mechanical
intermediate term that the stricter hedonism construes
human nature.[5] Accordingly, when more of teleological
activity came to be imputed to man, less was thereby allowed
to the complex of events. Or it may be put in the
converse form: When less of a teleological continuity came
to be imputed to the course of events, more was thereby
imputed to man's life process. The latter form of state-*

[Footnote 5: It may be remarked, by the way, that the use of the differential
calculus and similar mathematical expedients in the discussion of
marginal utility and the like, proceeds on this psychological
ground, and that the theoretical results so arrived at are valid to
the full extent only if this hedonistic psychology is accepted.]
-----File: 166.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
*ment probably suggests the direction in which the causal
relation runs, more nearly than the former. The change
whereby the two metaphysical premises in question have
lost their earlier force and symmetry, therefore, amounts
to a (partial) shifting of the seat of putative personality
from inanimate phenomena to man.

It may be mentioned in passing, as a detail lying perhaps
afield, yet not devoid of significance for latter-day
economic speculation, that this elimination of personality,
and so of teleological content, from the sequence of events,
and its increasing imputation to the conduct of the human
agent, is incident to a growing resort to an apprehension
of phenomena in terms of process rather than in terms of
outcome, as was the habit in earlier schemes of knowledge.
On this account the categories employed are, in a gradually
increasing degree, categories of process,--"dynamic"
categories. But categories of process applied to conduct,
to discretionary action, are teleological categories:
whereas categories of process applied in the case of a
sequence where the members of the sequence are not conceived
to be charged with discretion, are, by the force
of this conception itself, non-teleological, quantitative
categories. The continuity comprised in the concept of
process as applied to conduct is consequently a spiritual,
teleological continuity: whereas the concept of process
under the second head, the non-teleological sequence,
comprises a continuity of a quantitative, causal kind, substantially
the conservation of energy. In its turn the
growing resort to categories of process in the formulation
of knowledge is probably due to the epistemological
discipline of modern mechanical industry, the technological
exigencies of which enforce a constant recourse to the
apprehension of phenomena in terms of process, differing
therein from the earlier forms of industry, which neither
-----File: 167.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
obtruded visible mechanical process so constantly upon
the apprehension nor so imperatively demanded an articulate
recognition of continuity in the processes actually involved.
The contrast in this respect is still more pronounced
between the discipline of modern life in an industrial
community and the discipline of life under the conventions
of status and exploit that formerly prevailed.

To return to the benign order of nature, or the meliorative
trend,--its passing, as an article of economic faith,
was not due to criticism leveled against it by the later
classical economists on grounds of its epistemological incongruity.
It was tried on its merits, as an alleged
account of facts; and the weight of evidence went against
it. The belief in a self-realising trend had no sooner
reached a competent and exhaustive statement--<i>e.g.</i>, at
Bastiat's hands, as a dogma of the harmony of interests
specifically applicable to the details of economic life--than
it began to lose ground. With his usual concision
and incisiveness, Cairnes completed the destruction of
Bastiat's special dogma, and put it forever beyond a rehearing.
But Cairnes is not a destructive critic of the
classical political economy, at least not in intention: he is
an interpreter and continuer--perhaps altogether the
clearest and truest continuer--of the classical teaching.
While he confuted Bastiat and discredited Bastiat's peculiar
dogma, he did not thereby put the order of nature
bodily out of the science. He qualified and improved it,
very much as Mill qualified and improved the tenets of the
hedonistic psychology. As Mill and the ethical speculation
of his generation threw more of personality into the
hedonistic psychology, so Cairnes and the speculators on
scientific method (such as Mill and Jevons) attenuated
the imputation of personality or teleological content to the
process of material cause and effect. The work is of
-----File: 168.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\gst\aagam\Hermit00\-----------------
course, by no means, an achievement of Cairnes alone; but
he is, perhaps, the best exponent of this advance in economic
theory. In Cairnes's redaction this foundation of
the science became the concept of a colorless normality.

It was in Cairnes's time the fashion for speculators in
other fields than the physical sciences to look to those
sciences for guidance in method and for legitimation of
the ideals of scientific theory which they were at work
to realize. More than that, the large and fruitful achievements
of the physical sciences had so far taken men's
attention captive as to give an almost instinctive predilection
for the methods that had approved themselves in that
field. The ways of thinking which had on this ground
become familiar to all scholars occupied with any scientific
inquiry, had permeated their thinking on any subject
whatever. This is eminently true of British thinking.

It had come to be a commonplace of the physical sciences
that "natural laws" are of the nature of empirical
generalisations simply, or even of the nature of arithmetical
averages. Even the underlying preconception of the
modern physical sciences--the law of the conservation of
energy, or persistence of quantity--was claimed to be an
empirical generalisation, arrived at inductively and verified
by experiment. It is true the alleged proof of the
law took the whole conclusion for granted at the start, and
used it constantly as a tacit axiom at every step in the
argument which was to establish its truth; but that fact
serves rather to emphasise than to call in question the
abiding faith which these empiricists had in the sole efficacy
of empirical generalisation. Had they been able
overtly to admit any other than an associational origin of
knowledge, they would have seen the impossibility of accounting
on the mechanical grounds of association for the
premise on which all experience of mechanical fact rests.
-----File: 169.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
That any other than a mechanical origin should be assigned
to experience, or that any other than a so-conceived
empirical ground was to be admitted for any general principle,
was incompatible with the prejudices of men trained
in the school of the associational psychology, however
widely they perforce departed from this ideal in practice.
Nothing of the nature of a personal element was to be
admitted into these fundamental empirical generalisations;
and nothing, therefore, of the nature of a discretionary or
teleological movement was to be comprised in the generalisations
to be accepted as "natural laws." Natural laws
must in no degree be imbued with personality, must say
nothing of an ulterior end; but for all that they remained
"laws" of the sequences subsumed under them. So far
is the reduction to colorless terms carried by Mill, for
instance, that he formulates the natural laws as empirically
ascertained sequences simply, even excluding or
avoiding all imputation of causal continuity, as that term
is commonly understood by the unsophisticated. In
Mill's ideal no more of organic connection or continuity
between the members of a sequence is implied in subsuming
them under a law of causal relationship than is
given by the ampersand. He is busied with dynamic
sequences, but he persistently confines himself to static
terms.

Under the guidance of the associational psychology,
therefore, the extreme of discontinuity in the deliverances
of inductive research is aimed at by those economists--Mill
and Cairnes being taken as typical--whose names
have been associated with deductive methods in modern
science. With a fine sense of truth they saw that the
notion of causal continuity, as a premise of scientific generalisation,
is an essentially metaphysical postulate; and
they avoided its treacherous ground by denying it, and
-----File: 170.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
construing causal sequence to mean a uniformity of coexistences
and successions simply. But, since a strict
uniformity is nowhere to be observed at first hand in the
phenomena with which the investigator is occupied, it has
to be found by a laborious interpretation of the phenomena
and a diligent abstraction and allowance for disturbing
circumstances, whatever may be the meaning of a
disturbing circumstance where causal continuity is denied.
In this work of interpretation and expurgation the investigator
proceeds on a conviction of the orderliness of the
natural sequence. "Natura non facit saltum": a maxim
which has no meaning within the stricter limits of the
associational theory of knowledge.

Before anything can be said as to the orderliness of the
sequence, a point of view must be chosen by the speculator,
with respect to which the sequence in question does
or does not fulfill this condition of orderliness; that is to
say, with respect to which it is a sequence. The endeavor
to avoid all metaphysical premises fails here as everywhere.
The associationists, to whom economics owes its
transition from the older classical phase to the modern or
quasi-classical, chose as their guiding point of view the
metaphysical postulate of congruity,--in substance, the
"similarity" of the associationist theory of knowledge.
This must be called their <i>proton pseudos</i>, if associationism
pure and simple is to be accepted. The notion of congruity
works out in laws of resemblance and equivalence,
in both of which it is plain to the modern psychologist
that a metaphysical ground of truth, antecedent to and
controlling empirical data, is assumed. But the use of
the postulate of congruence as a test of scientific truth
has the merit of avoiding all open dealing with an imputed
substantiality of the data handled, such as would be involved
in the overt use of the concept of causation. The
-----File: 171.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
data are congruous among themselves, as items of knowledge;
and they may therefore be handled in a logical
synthesis and concatenation on the basis of this congruence
alone, without committing the scientist to an imputation
of a kinetic or motor relation between them. The
metaphysics of process is thereby avoided, in appearance.
The sequences are uniform or consistent with one another,
taken as articles of theoretical synthesis simply;
and so they become elements of a system or discipline of
knowledge in which the test of theoretical truth is the
congruence of the system with its premises.

In all this there is a high-wrought appearance of matter-of-fact,
and all metaphysical subreption of a non-empirical
or non-mechanical standard of reality or substantiality is
avoided in appearance. The generalisations which make
up such a system of knowledge are, in this way, stated in
terms of the system itself; and when a competent formulation
of the alleged uniformities has been so made in
terms of their congruity or equivalence with the prime
postulates of the system, the work of theoretical inquiry
is done.

The concrete premises from which proceeds the systematic
knowledge of this generation of economists are
certain very concise assumptions concerning human nature,
and certain slightly less concise generalisations of
physical fact,[6] presumed to be mechanically empirical generalisations.
These postulates afford the standard of normality.
Whatever situation or course of events can be
shown to express these postulates without mitigation is
normal; and wherever a departure from this normal
course of things occurs, it is due to disturbing causes,--that
is to say, to causes not comprised in the main prem-*

[Footnote 6: See, <i>e.g.</i>, Cairnes, <i>Character and Logical Method</i> (New
York), p. 71.]
-----File: 172.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
*ises of the science,--and such departures are to be taken
account of by way of qualification. Such departures and
such qualification are constantly present in the facts to be
handled by the science; but, being not congruous with the
underlying postulates, they have no place in the body of
the science. The laws of the science, that which makes
up the economist's theoretical knowledge, are laws of the
normal case. The normal case does not occur in concrete
fact. These laws are, therefore, in Cairnes's terminology,
"hypothetical" truths; and the science is a "hypothetical"
science. They apply to concrete facts only as the
facts are interpreted and abstracted from, in the light of
the underlying postulates. The science is, therefore, a
theory of the normal case, a discussion of the concrete
facts of life in respect of their degree of approximation
to the normal case. That is to say, it is a taxonomic
science.

Of course, in the work actually done by these economists
this standpoint of rigorous normality is not consistently
maintained; nor is the unsophisticated imputation
of causality to the facts under discussion consistently
avoided. The associationist postulate, that causal sequence
means empirical uniformity simply, is in great
measure forgotten when the subject-matter of the science
is handled in detail. Especially is it true that in Mill the
dry light of normality is greatly relieved by a strong common
sense. But the great truths or laws of the science
remain hypothetical laws; and the test of scientific reality
is congruence with the hypothetical laws, not coincidence
with matter-of-fact events.

The earlier, more archaic metaphysics of the science,
which saw in the orderly correlation and sequence of
events a constraining guidance of an extra-causal, teleological
kind, in this way becomes a metaphysics of nor-*
-----File: 173.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*mality which asserts no extra-causal constraint over
events, but contents itself with establishing correlations,
equivalencies, homologies, and theories concerning the
conditions of an economic equilibrium. The movement,
the process of economic life, is not overlooked, and it
may even be said that it is not neglected; but the pure
theory, in its final deliverances, deals not with the dynamics,
but with the statics of the case. The concrete
subject-matter of the science is, of course, the process of
economic life,--that is unavoidably the case,--and in so
far the discussion must be accepted as work bearing on
the dynamics of the phenomena discussed; but even then
it remains true that the aim of this work in dynamics is a
determination and taxis of the outcome of the process
under discussion rather than a theory of the process as
such. The process is rated in terms of the equilibrium
to which it tends or should tend, not conversely. The
outcome of the process, taken in its relation of equivalence
within the system, is the point at which the inquiry comes
to rest. It is not primarily the point of departure for an
inquiry into what may follow. The science treats of a
balanced system rather than of a proliferation. In this
lies its characteristic difference from the later evolutionary
sciences. It is this characteristic bent of the science
that leads its spokesman, Cairnes, to turn so kindly to
chemistry rather than to the organic sciences, when he
seeks an analogy to economics among the physical sciences.[7]
What Cairnes has in mind in his appeal to chemistry
is, of course, the received, extremely taxonomic
(systematic) chemistry of his own time, not the tentatively
genetic theories of a slightly later day.

<tb>

It may seem that in the characterisation just offered of

[Footnote 7: <i>Character and Logical Method</i>, p. 62.]
-----File: 174.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
the standpoint of normality in economics there is too
strong an implication of colorlessness and impartiality.
The objection holds as regards much of the work of the
modern economists of the classical line. It will hold true
even as to much of Cairnes's work; but it cannot be admitted
as regards Cairnes's ideal of scientific aim and
methods. The economists whose theories Cairnes received
and developed, assuredly did not pursue the discussion
of the normal case with an utterly dispassionate
animus. They had still enough of the older teleological
metaphysics left to give color to the accusation brought
against them that they were advocates of <i>laissez-faire</i>.
The preconception of the utilitarians,--in substance the
natural-rights preconception,--that unrestrained human
conduct will result in the greatest human happiness, retains
so much of its force in Cairnes's time as is implied
in the then current assumption that what is normal is also
right. The economists, and Cairnes among them, not
only are concerned to find out what is normal and to determine
what consummation answers to the normal, but they
also are at pains to approve that consummation. It is
this somewhat uncritical and often unavowed identification
of the normal with the right that gives colorable
ground for the widespread vulgar prejudice, to which
Cairnes draws attention,[8] that political economy "sanctions"
one social arrangement and "condemns" another.
And it is against this uncritical identification of two essentially
unrelated principles or categories that Cairnes's
essay on "Political Economy and Laissez-faire," and in
good part also that on Bastiat, are directed. But, while
this is one of the many points at which Cairnes has substantially
advanced the ideals of the science, his own concluding
argument shows him to have been but half-way

[Footnote 8: <i>Essays in Political Economy</i>, pp. 260-264.]
-----File: 175.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
emancipated from the prejudice, even while most effectively
combating it.[9] It is needless to point out that the
like prejudice is still present in good vigor in many later
economists who have had the full benefit of Cairnes's
teachings on this head.[10] Considerable as Cairnes's
achievement in this matter undoubtedly was, it effected
a mitigation rather than an elimination of the untenable
metaphysics against which he contended.

The advance in the general point of view from animistic
teleology to taxonomy is shown in a curiously succinct
manner in a parenthetical clause of Cairnes's in the chapter
on Normal Value.[11] With his acceptance of the later
point of view involved in the use of the new term, Cairnes
becomes the interpreter of the received theoretical results.
The received positions are not subjected to a destructive
criticism. The aim is to complete them where they fall
short and to cut off what may be needless or what may
run beyond the safe ground of scientific generalisation.
In his work of redaction, Cairnes does not avow--probably
he is not sensible of--any substantial shifting of the
point of view or any change in the accepted ground of
theoretic reality. But his advance to an unteleological
taxonomy none the less changes the scope and aim of his
theoretical discussion. The discussion of Normal Value
may be taken in illustration.

Cairnes is not content to find (with Adam Smith) that
value will "naturally" coincide with or be measured by

[Footnote 9: See especially <i>Essays</i>, pp. 263, 264.]

[Footnote 10: It may be interesting to point out that the like identification
of the categories of normality and right gives the dominant note
of Mr. Spencer's ethical and social philosophy, and that later
economists of the classical line are prone to be Spencerians.]

[Footnote 11: "Normal value (called by Adam Smith and Ricardo 'natural
value,' and by Mill 'necessary value,' but best expressed, it seems
to me, by the term which I have used)." <i>Leading Principles</i>
(New York), p. 45.]
-----File: 176.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\msmoose\Hermit00\-----------
cost of production, or even (with Mill) that cost of production
must, in the long run, "necessarily" determine
value. "This ... is to take a much too limited view of
the range of this phenomenon."[12] He is concerned to
determine not only this general tendency of values to a
normal, but all those characteristic circumstances as well
which condition this tendency and which determine the
normal to which values tend. His inquiry pursues the
phenomena of value in a normal economic system rather
than the manner and rate of approach of value relations
to a teleologically or hedonistically defensible consummation.
It therefore becomes an exhaustive but very discriminating
analysis of the circumstances that bear upon
market values, with a view to determine what circumstances
are normally present; that is to say, what circumstances
conditioning value are commonly effective and at
the same time in consonance with the premises of economic
theory. These effective conditions, in so far as
they are not counted anomalous and, therefore, to be set
aside in the theoretical discussion, are the circumstances
under which a hedonistic valuation process in any modern
industrial community is held perforce to take place,--the
circumstances which are held to enforce a recognition and
rating of the pleasure-bearing capacity of facts. They
are not, as under the earlier cost-of-production doctrines,
the circumstances which determine the magnitude of the
forces spent in the production of the valuable article.
Therefore, the normal (natural) value is no longer (as
with Adam Smith, and even to some extent with his
classical successors) the primary or initial fact in value
theory, the substantial fact of which the market value is
an approximate expression and by which the latter is
controlled. The argument does not, as formerly, set out

[Footnote 12: <i>Leading Principles</i>, p. 45.]
-----File: 177.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
from that expenditure of personal force which was once
conceived to constitute the substantial value of goods, and
then construe market value to be an approximate and
uncertain expression of this substantial fact. The direction
in which the argument runs is rather the reverse of
this. The point of departure is taken from the range of
market values and the process of bargaining by which
these values are determined. This latter is taken to be
a process of discrimination between various kinds and
degrees of discomfort, and the average or consistent outcome
of such a process of bargaining constitutes normal
value. It is only by virtue of a presumed equivalence
between the discomfort undergone and the concomitant
expenditure, whether of labor or of wealth, that the normal
value so determined is conceived to be an expression
of the productive force that goes into the creation of the
valuable goods. Cost being only in uncertain equivalence
with sacrifice or discomfort, as between different persons,
the factor of cost falls into the background; and the
process of bargaining, which is in the foreground, being
a process of valuation, a balancing of individual demand
and supply, it follows that a law of reciprocal demand
comes in to supplant the law of cost. In all this the
proximate causes at work in the determination of values
are plainly taken account of more adequately than in
earlier cost-of-production doctrines; but they are taken
account of with a view to explaining the mutual adjustment
and interrelation of elements in a system rather than
to explain either a developmental sequence or the working
out of a foreordained end.

This revision of the cost-of-production doctrine,
whereby it takes the form of a law of reciprocal demand,
is in good part effected by a consistent reduction of cost
to terms of sacrifice,--a reduction more consistently car-*
-----File: 178.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
*ried through by Cairnes than it had been by earlier hedonists,
and extended by Cairnes's successors with even more
far-reaching results. By this step the doctrine of cost is
not only brought into closer accord with the neo-hedonistic
premises, in that it in a greater degree throws the
stress upon the factor of personal discrimination, but it
also gives the doctrine a more general bearing upon
economic conduct and increases its serviceability as a comprehensive
principle for the classification of economic
phenomena. In the further elaboration of the hedonistic
theory of value at the hands of Jevons and the Austrians
the same principle of sacrifice comes to serve as the chief
ground of procedure.

<tb>

Of the foundations of later theory, in so far as the postulates
of later economists differ characteristically from
those of Mill and Cairnes, little can be said in this place.
Nothing but the very general features of the later development
can be taken up; and even these general features of
the existing theoretic situation can not be handled with
the same confidence as the corresponding features of a
past phase of speculation. With respect to writers of the
present or the more recent past the work of natural selection,
as between variants of scientific aim and animus and
between more or less divergent points of view, has not yet
taken effect; and it would be over-hazardous to attempt
an anticipation of the results of the selection that lies in
great part yet in the future. As regards the directions of
theoretical work suggested by the names of Professor
Marshall, Mr. Cannan, Professor Clark, Mr. Pierson,
Professor Loria, Professor Schmoller, the Austrian
group,--no off-hand decision is admissible as between
these candidates for the honor, or, better, for the work,
of continuing the main current of economic speculation
-----File: 179.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\seowphm\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
and inquiry. No attempt will here be made even to pass
a verdict on the relative claims of the recognised two or
three main "schools" of theory, beyond the somewhat
obvious finding that, for the purpose in hand, the so-called
Austrian school is scarcely distinguishable from the
neo-classical, unless it be in the different distribution of
emphasis. The divergence between the modernised classical
views, on the one hand, and the historical and Marxist
schools, on the other hand, is wider,--so much so,
indeed, as to bar out a consideration of the postulates of
the latter under the same head of inquiry with the former.
The inquiry, therefore, confines itself to the one line
standing most obviously in unbroken continuity with that
body of classical economics whose life history has been
traced in outline above. And, even for this phase of
modernised classical economics, it seems necessary to
limit discussion, for the present, to a single strain, selected
as standing peculiarly close to the classical source,
at the same time that it shows unmistakable adaptation
to the later habits of thought and methods of knowledge.

For this later development in the classical line of political
economy, Mr. Keynes's book may fairly be taken as
the maturest exposition of the aims and ideals of the science;
while Professor Marshall excellently exemplifies the
best work that is being done under the guidance of the
classical antecedents. As, after a lapse of a dozen or
fifteen years from Cairnes's days of full conviction, Mr.
Keynes interprets the aims of modern economic science,
it has less of the "hypothetical" character assigned it by
Cairnes; that is to say, it confines its inquiry less closely
to the ascertainment of the normal case and the interpretative
subsumption of facts under the normal. It takes
fuller account of the genesis and developmental continuity
-----File: 180.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
of all features of modern economic life, gives more and
closer attention to institutions and their history. This is,
no doubt, due, in part at least, to impulse received from
German economists; and in so far it also reflects the peculiarly
vague and bewildered attitude of protest that
characterises the earlier expositions of the historical
school. To the same essentially extraneous source is
traceable the theoretic blur embodied in Mr. Keynes's attitude
of tolerance towards the conception of economics as
a "normative" science having to do with "economic
ideals," or an "applied economics" having to do with
"economic precepts."[13] An inchoate departure from the
consistent taxonomic ideals shows itself in the tentative
resort to historical and genetic formulations, as well as in
Mr. Keynes's pervading inclination to define the scope of
the science, not by exclusion of what are conceived to be
non-economic phenomena, but by disclosing a point of
view from which all phenomena are seen to be economic
facts. The science comes to be characterised not by the
delimitation of a range of facts, as in Cairnes,[14] but as an
inquiry into the bearing which all facts have upon men's
economic activity. It is no longer that certain phenomena
belong within the science, but rather that the science is
concerned with any and all phenomena as seen from the
point of view of the economic interest. Mr. Keynes does
not go fully to the length which this last proposition indicates.
He finds[15] that political economy "treats of the
phenomena arising out of the economic activities of mankind
in society"; but, while the discussion by which he

[Footnote 13: <i>Scope and Method of Political Economy</i> (London, 1891),
chaps. i and ii.]

[Footnote 14: <i>Character and Logical Method</i>; <i>e.g.</i>, Lecture II, especially
pp. 53, 54, and 71.]

[Footnote 15: <i>Scope and Method of Political Economy</i>, chap. iii, particularly
p. 97.]
-----File: 181.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------------
leads up to this definition might be construed to say that
all the activities of mankind in society have an economic
bearing, and should therefore come within the view of the
science, Mr. Keynes does not carry out his elucidation of
the matter to that broad conclusion. Neither can it be
said that modern political economy has, in practice, taken
on the scope and character which this extreme position
would assign it

The passage from which the above citation is taken is
highly significant also in another and related bearing, and
it is at the same time highly characteristic of the most
effective modernised classical economics. The subject-matter
of the science has come to be the "economic activities"
of mankind, and the phenomena in which these
activities manifest themselves. So Professor Marshall's
work, for instance, is, in aim, even if not always in
achievement, a theoretical handling of human activity in
its economic bearing,--an inquiry into the multiform
phases and ramifications of that process of valuation of
the material means of life by virtue of which man is an
economic agent. And still it remains an inquiry directed
to the determination of the conditions of an equilibrium
of activities and a quiescent normal situation. It is not
in any eminent degree an inquiry into cultural or institutional
development as affected by economic exigencies or
by the economic interest of the men whose activities are
analysed and portrayed. Any sympathetic reader of Professor
Marshall's great work--and that must mean every
reader--comes away with a sense of swift and smooth
movement and interaction of parts; but it is the movement
of a consummately conceived and self-balanced mechanism,
not that of a cumulatively unfolding process or an
institutional adaptation to cumulatively unfolding exigencies.
The taxonomic bearing is, after all, the dominant
-----File: 182.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
feature. It is significant of the same point that even in
his discussion of such vitally dynamic features of the
economic process as the differential effectiveness of different
laborers or of different industrial plants, as well as of
the differential advantages of consumers, Professor Marshall
resorts to an adaptation of so essentially taxonomic
a category as the received concept of rent. Rent is a pecuniary
category, a category of income, which is essentially
a final term, not a category of the motor term, work
or interest.[16] It is not a factor or a feature of the process
of industrial life, but a phenomenon of the pecuniary situation
which emerges from this process under given conventional
circumstances. However far-reaching and various
the employment of the rent concept in economic
theory has been, it has through all permutations remained,
what it was to begin with, a rubric in the classification of
incomes. It is a pecuniary, not an industrial category.
In so far as resort is had to the rent concept in the formulation
of a theory of the industrial process,--as in
Professor Marshall's work,--it comes to a statement of
the process in terms of its residue. Let it not seem presumptuous
to say that, great and permanent as is the value
of Professor Marshall's exposition of quasi-rents and the
like, the endeavor which it involves to present in terms of
a concluded system what is of the nature of a fluent process
has made the exposition unduly bulky, unwieldy, and
inconsequent.

There is a curious reminiscence of the perfect taxonomic
day in Mr. Keynes's characterisation of political
economy as a "positive science," "the sole province of
which is to establish economic uniformities";[17] and, in

[Footnote 16: "Interest" is, of course, here used in the sense which it has
in modern psychological discussion.]

[Footnote 17: <i>Scope and Method of Political Economy</i>, p. 46.]
-----File: 183.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
this resort to the associationist expedient of defining a
natural law as a "uniformity," Mr. Keynes is also borne
out by Professor Marshall.[18] But this and other survivals
of the taxonomic terminology, or even of the taxonomic
canons of procedure, do not hinder the economists
of the modern school from doing effective work of a character
that must be rated as genetic rather than taxonomic.
Professor Marshall's work in economics is not unlike that
of Asa Gray in botany, who, while working in great part
within the lines of "systematic botany" and adhering to
its terminology, and on the whole also to its point of view,
very materially furthered the advance of the science outside
the scope of taxonomy.

Professor Marshall shows an aspiration to treat economic
life as a development; and, at least superficially,
much of his work bears the appearance of being a discussion
of this kind. In this endeavor his work is typical of
what is aimed at by many of the later economists. The
aim shows itself with a persistent recurrence in his <i>Principles</i>.
His chosen maxim is, "Natura non facit saltum,"--a
maxim that might well serve to designate the prevailing
attitude of modern economists towards questions of
economic development as well as towards questions of
classification or of economic policy. His insistence on the
continuity of development and of the economic structure
of communities is a characteristic of the best work along
the later line of classical political economy. All this gives
an air of evolutionism to the work. Indeed, the work of
the neo-classical economics might be compared, probably
without offending any of its adepts, with that of the early
generation of Darwinians, though such a comparison
might somewhat shrewdly have to avoid any but super-*

[Footnote 18: <i>Principles of Economics</i>, Vol. I, Book I, chap, vi, sect. 6,
especially p. 105 (3d edition).]
-----File: 184.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*ficial features. Economists of the present day are commonly
evolutionists, in a general way. They commonly
accept, as other men do, the general results of the evolutionary
speculation in those directions in which the evolutionary
method has made its way. But the habit of
handling by evolutionist methods the facts with which
their own science is concerned has made its way among
the economists to but a very uncertain degree.

The prime postulate of evolutionary science, the preconception
constantly underlying the inquiry, is the notion of
a cumulative causal sequence; and writers on economics
are in the habit of recognising that the phenomena with
which they are occupied are subject to such a law of development.
Expressions of assent to this proposition
abound. But the economists have not worked out or hit
upon a method by which the inquiry in economics may
consistently be conducted under the guidance of this postulate.
Taking Professor Marshall as exponent, it appears
that, while the formulations of economic theory are
not conceived to be arrived at by way of an inquiry into
the developmental variation of economic institutions and
the like, the theorems arrived at are held, and no doubt
legitimately, to apply to the past,[19] and with due reserve
also to the future, phases of the development. But these
theorems apply to the various phases of the development
not as accounting for the developmental sequence, but as
limiting the range of variation. They say little, if anything,
as to the order of succession, as to the derivation
and the outcome of any given phase, or as to the causal
relation of one phase of any given economic convention or
scheme of relations to any other. They indicate the conditions
of survival to which any innovation is subject, sup-*

[Footnote 19: See, <i>e.g.</i>, Professor Marshall's "Reply" to Professor Cunningham
in the <i>Economic Journal</i> for 1892, pp. 508-113.[** probable typo in original: "508" should read "108" - see note 21 on 186.png]]
-----File: 185.png---\skywrite\DocSoman\macaw89\msmoose\Hermit00\----------
*posing the innovation to have taken place, not the conditions
of variational growth. The economic laws, the
"statements of uniformity," are therefore, when construed
in an evolutionary bearing, theorems concerning
the superior or the inferior limit of persistent innovations,
as the case may be.[20] It is only in this negative, selective
bearing that the current economic laws are held to be
laws of developmental continuity; and it should be added
that they have hitherto found but relatively scant application
at the hands of the economists, even for this purpose.

Again, as applied to economic activities under a given
situation, as laws governing activities in equilibrium, the
economic laws are, in the main, laws of the limits within
which economic action of a given purpose runs. They
are theorems as to the limits which the economic (commonly
the pecuniary) interest imposes upon the range of
activities to which the other life interests of men incite,
rather than theorems as to the manner and degree in
which the economic interest creatively shapes the general
scheme of life. In great part they formulate the normal
inhibitory effect of economic exigencies rather than the
cumulative modification and diversification of human activities
through the economic interest, by initiating and
guiding habits of life and of thought. This, of course,
does not go to say that economists are at all slow to
credit the economic exigencies with a large share in the
growth of culture; but, while claims of this kind are large
and recurrent, it remains true that the laws which make
up the framework of economic doctrine are, when construed
as generalisations of causal relation, laws of conservation
and selection, not of genesis and proliferation.
The truth of this, which is but a commonplace generalisa-*

[Footnote 20: This is well illustrated by what Professor Marshall says of
the Ricardian law of rent in his "Reply," cited above.]
-----File: 186.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*tion, might be shown in detail with respect to such fundamental
theorems as the laws of rent, of profits, of wages,
of the increasing or diminishing returns of industry, of
population, of competitive prices, of cost of production.

In consonance with this quasi-evolutionary tone of the
neo-classical political economy, or as an expression of it,
comes the further clarified sense that nowadays attaches
to the terms "normal" and economic "laws." The laws
have gained in colorlessness, until it can no longer be said
that the concept of normality implies approval of the phenomena
to which it is applied.[21] They are in an increasing
degree laws of conduct, though they still continue to
formulate conduct in hedonistic terms; that is to say,
conduct is construed in terms of its sensuous effect, not in
terms of its teleological content. The light of the science
is a drier light than it was, but it continues to be shed
upon the accessories of human action rather than upon
the process itself. The categories employed for the purpose
of knowing this economic conduct with which the
scientists occupy themselves are not the categories under
which the men at whose hands the action takes place themselves
apprehend their own action at the instant of acting.
Therefore, economic conduct still continues to be somewhat
mysterious to the economists; and they are forced to
content themselves with adumbrations whenever the discussion
touches this central, substantial fact.

All this, of course, is intended to convey no dispraise of
the work done, nor in any way to disparage the theories
which the passing generation of economists have elaborated,
or the really great and admirable body of knowledge
which they have brought under the hand of the science;

[Footnote 21: See, <i>e.g.</i>, Marshall, <i>Principles</i>, Book I, chap, vi, sect. 6, pp.
105-108. The like dispassionateness is visible in most other
modern writers on theory; as, <i>e.g.</i>, Clark, Cannan, and the
Austrians.]
-----File: 187.png---\skywrite\DocSoman\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\------------
but only to indicate the direction in which the inquiry in
its later phases--not always with full consciousness--is
shifting as regards its categories and its point of view.
The discipline of life in a modern community, particularly
the industrial life, strongly re√´nforced by the modern
sciences, has divested our knowledge of non-human phenomena
of that fullness of self-directing life that was
once imputed to them, and has reduced this knowledge to
terms of opaque causal sequence. It has thereby narrowed
the range of discretionary, teleological action to the
human agent alone; and so it is compelling our knowledge
of human conduct, in so far as it is distinguished from the
non-human, to fall into teleological terms. Foot-pounds,
calories, geometrically progressive procreation, and doses
of capital, have not been supplanted by the equally uncouth
denominations of habits, propensities, aptitudes, and
conventions, nor does there seem to be any probability that
they will be; but the discussion which continues to run
in terms of the former class of concepts is in an increasing
degree seeking support in concepts of the latter class.

PROFESSOR CLARK'S ECONOMICS[1]


For some time past economists have been looking with
lively anticipation for such a comprehensive statement of
Mr. Clark's doctrines as is now offered. The leading
purpose of the present volume[2] is "to offer a brief and
provisional statement of the more general laws of progress";
although it also comprises a more abridged restatement
of the laws of "Economic Statics" already set
forth in fuller form in his <i>Distribution of Wealth</i>.
Though brief, this treatise is to be taken as systematically
complete, as including in due correlation all the "essentials"
of Mr. Clark's theoretical system. As such, its
publication is an event of unusual interest and consequence.

Mr. Clark's position among this generation of economists
is a notable and commanding one. No serious student
of economic theory will, or can afford to, forego a
pretty full acquaintance with his development of doctrines.
Nor will any such student avoid being greatly influenced
by the position which Mr. Clark takes on any
point of theory on which he may speak, and many look
confidently to him for guidance where it is most needed.
Very few of those interested in modern theory are under
no obligations to him. He has, at the same time, in a
singular degree the gift of engaging the affections as well
as the attention of students in his field. Yet the critic is

Economics</i>, Vol. XXII, Feb., 1908.]

[Footnote 2: <i>The Essentials of Economic Theory, as Applied to Modern
Problems of Industry and Public Policy.</i> By John Bates Clark.

-----File: 189.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
required to speak impersonally of Mr. Clark's work as a
phase of current economic theory.

In more than one respect Mr. Clark's position among
economists recalls the great figures in the science a hundred
years ago. There is the same rigid grasp of the
principles, the "essentials," out of which the broad theorems
of the system follow in due sequence and correlation;
and like the leaders of the classical era, while Mr.
Clark is always a theoretician, never to be diverted into
an inconsistent makeshift, he is moved by an alert and
sympathetic interest in current practical problems. While
his aim is a theoretical one, it is always with a view to the
theory of current affairs; and his speculations are animated
with a large sympathy and an aggressive interest
in the amelioration of the lot of man.

His relation to the ancient adepts of the science, however,
is something more substantial than a resemblance
only. He is, by spiritual consanguinity, a representative
of that classical school of thought that dominated the
science through the better part of the nineteenth century.
This is peculiarly true of Mr. Clark, as contrasted with
many of those contemporaries who have fought for the
marginal-utility doctrines. Unlike these spokesmen of
the Austrian wing, he has had the insight and courage to
see the continuity between the classical position and his
own, even where he advocates drastic changes in the
classical body of doctrines. And although his system of
theory embodies substantially all that the consensus of
theorists approves in the Austrian contributions to the
science, yet he has arrived at his position on these heads
not under the guidance of the Austrian school, but, avowedly,
by an unbroken development out of the position
given by the older generation of economists.[3] Again, in

[Footnote 3: <i>Cf., e.g.</i> <i>The Distribution of Wealth</i>, p. 376, note.]
-----File: 190.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
the matter of the psychological postulates of the science,
he accepts a hedonism as simple, unaffected, and uncritical
as that of Jevons or of James Mill. In this respect his
work is as true to the canons of the classical school as the
best work of the theoreticians of the Austrian observance.
There is the like unhesitating appeal to the calculus of
pleasure and pain as the indefeasible ground of action and
solvent of perplexities, and there is the like readiness to
reduce all phenomena to terms of a "normal," or "natural,"
scheme of life constructed on the basis of this hedonistic
calculus. Even in the ready recourse to "conjectural
history," to use Steuart's phrase, Mr. Clark's
work is at one with both the early classical and the late
(Jevons-Austrian) marginal-utility school. It has the
virtues of both, coupled with the graver shortcomings of
both. But, as his view exceeds theirs in breadth and generosity,
so his system of theory is a more competent expression
of current economic science than what is offered
by the spokesmen of the Jevons-Austrian wing. It is as
such, as a competent and consistent system of current
economic theory, that it is here intended to discuss Mr.
Clark's work, not as a body of doctrines peculiar to Mr.
Clark or divergent from the main current.

<tb>

Since hedonism came to rule economic science, the science
has been in the main a theory of distribution,--distribution
of ownership and of income. This is true
both of the classical school and of those theorists who
have taken an attitude of ostensible antagonism to the
classical school. The exceptions to the rule are late and
comparatively few, and they are not found among the
economists who accept the hedonistic postulate as their
point of departure. And, consistently with the spirit of
hedonism, this theory of distribution has centered about
-----File: 191.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\---
a doctrine of exchange value (or price) and has worked
out its scheme of (normal) distribution in terms of (normal)
price. The normal economic community, upon
which theoretical interest has converged, is a business
community, which centers about the market, and whose
scheme of life is a scheme of profit and loss. Even when
some considerable attention is ostensibly devoted to
theories of consumption and production, in these systems
of doctrine the theories are constructed in terms of ownership,
price, and acquisition, and so reduce themselves
in substance to doctrines of distributive acquisition.[4] In
this respect Mr. Clark's work is true to the received
canons. The "Essentials of Economic Theory" are the
essentials of the hedonistic theory of distribution, with
sundry reflections on related topics. The scope of Mr.
Clark's economics, indeed, is even more closely limited by
concepts of distribution than many others, since he persistently
analyses production in terms of value, and value
is a concept of distribution.

<tb>

As Mr. Clark justly observes (p. 4), "The primitive
and general facts concerning industry ... need to be
known before the social facts can profitably be studied."
In these early pages of the treatise, as in other works of
its class, there is repeated reference to that more primitive
and simple scheme of economic life out of which the
modern complex scheme has developed, and it is repeatedly
indicated that in order to an understanding of the
play of forces in the more advanced stages of economic
development and complication, it is necessary to apprehend
these forces in their unsophisticated form as they
work out in the simple scheme prevalent on the plane of

[Footnote 4: See, <i>e.g.</i>, J. S. Mill, <i>Political Economy</i>, Book I; Marshall,
<i>Principles of Economics</i>, Vol. I, Books II-V.]
-----File: 192.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\msmoose\Hermit00\-
primitive life. Indeed, to a reader not well acquainted
with Mr. Clark's scope and method of economic theorising,
these early pages would suggest that he is preparing
for something in the way of a genetic study,--a study of
economic institutions approached from the side of their
origins. It looks as if the intended line of approach to
the modern situation might be such as an evolutionist
would choose, who would set out with showing what
forces are at work in the primitive economic community,
and then trace the cumulative growth and complication of
these factors as they presently take form in the institutions
of a later phase of the development. Such, however,
is not Mr. Clark's intention. The effect of his recourse
to "primitive life" is simply to throw into the
foreground, in a highly unreal perspective, those features
which lend themselves to interpretation in terms of the
normalised competitive system. The best excuse that can
be offered for these excursions into "primitive life" is
that they have substantially nothing to do with the main
argument of the book, being of the nature of harmless and
graceful misinformation.

In the primitive economic situation--that is to say, in
savagery and the lower barbarism--there is, of course,
no "solitary hunter," living either in a cave or otherwise,
and there is no man who "makes by his own labor all the
goods that he uses," etc. It is, in effect, a highly meretricious
misrepresentation to speak in this connection of
"the economy of a man who works only for himself," and
say that "the inherent productive power of labor and capital
is of vital concern to him," because such a presentation
of the matter overlooks the main facts in the case in order
to put the emphasis on a feature which is of negligible
consequence. There is no reasonable doubt but that, at
least since mankind reached the human plane, the eco-*
-----File: 193.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-
*nomic unit has been not a "solitary hunter," but a community
of some kind; in which, by the way, women seem
in the early stages to have been the most consequential
factor instead of the man who works for himself. The
"capital" possessed by such a community--as, <i>e.g.</i>, a
band of California "Digger" Indians--was a negligible
quantity, more valuable to a collector of curios than to
any one else, and the loss of which to the "Digger"
squaws would mean very little. What was of "vital concern"
to them, indeed, what the life of the group depended
on absolutely, was the accumulated wisdom of the
squaws, the technology of their economic situation.[5] The
loss of the basket, digging-stick, and mortar, simply as
physical objects, would have signified little, but the conceivable
loss of the squaw's knowledge of the soil and
seasons, of food and fiber plants, and of mechanical expedients,
would have meant the present dispersal and starvation
of the community.

This may seem like taking Mr. Clark to task for an
inconsequential gap in his general information on Digger
Indians, Eskimos, and pal√¶olithic society at large. But
the point raised is not of negligible consequence for economic
theory, particularly not for any theory of "economic
dynamics" that turns in great part about questions
of capital and its uses at different stages of economic
development. In the primitive culture the quantity and
the value of mechanical appliances is relatively slight; and
whether the group is actually possessed of more or less
of such appliances at a given time is not a question of
first-rate importance. The loss of these objects--tangible
assets--would entail a transient inconvenience.
But the accumulated, habitual knowledge of the ways and

[Footnote 5: <i>Cf., e.g.</i>, such an account as Barrows, <i>Ethno-botany of the
Coahuilla Indians</i>.]
-----File: 194.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-
means involved in the production and use of these appliances
is the outcome of long experience and experimentation;
and, given this body of commonplace technological
information, the acquisition and employment of the suitable
apparatus is easily arranged. The great body of
commonplace knowledge made use of in industry is the
product and heritage of the group. In its essentials it is
known by common notoriety, and the "capital goods"
needed for putting this commonplace technological knowledge
to use are a slight matter,--practically within the
reach of every one. Under these circumstances the ownership
of "capital-goods" has no great significance, and,
as a practical fact, interest and wages are unknown, and
the "earning power of capital" is not seen to be "governed
by a specific power of productivity which resides in
capital-goods." But the situation changes, presently, by
what is called an advance "in the industrial arts." The
"capital" required to put the commonplace knowledge to
effect grows larger, and so its acquisition becomes an increasingly
difficult matter. Through "difficulty of attainment"
in adequate quantities, the apparatus and its ownership
become a matter of consequence; increasingly so,
until presently the equipment required for an effective
pursuit of industry comes to be greater than the common
man can hope to acquire in a lifetime. The commonplace
knowledge of ways and means, the accumulated experience
of mankind, is still transmitted in and by the body of
the community at large; but, for practical purposes, the
advanced "state of the industrial arts" has enabled the
owners of goods to corner the wisdom of the ancients
and the accumulated experience of the race. Hence
"capital," as it stands at that phase of the institution's
growth contemplated by Mr. Clark.

The "natural" system of free competition, or, as it was
-----File: 195.png---\Pitirim\rathindg@gmail.com\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-
once called, "the obvious and simple system of natural
liberty," is accordingly a phase of the development of the
institution of capital; and its claim to immutable dominion
is evidently as good as the like claim of any other phase
of cultural growth. The equity, or "natural justice,"
claimed for it is evidently just and equitable only in so far
as the conventions of ownership on which it rests continue
to be a secure integral part of the institutional furniture
of the community; that is to say, so long as these conventions
are part and parcel of the habits of thought of the
community; that is to say, so long as these things are
currently held to be just and equitable. This normalised
present, or "natural," state of Mr. Clark, is, as near as
may be, Senior's "Natural State of Man,"--the hypothetically
perfect competitive system; and economic theory
consists in the definition and classification of the phenomena
of economic life in terms of this hypothetical
competitive system.

Taken by itself, Mr. Clark's dealing with the past development
might be passed over with slight comment,
except for its negative significance, since it has no theoretical
connection with the present, or even with the
"natural" state in which the phenomena of economic
life are assumed to arrange themselves in a stable, normal
scheme. But his dealings with the future, and with the
present in so far as the present situation is conceived to
comprise "dynamic" factors, is of substantially the same
kind. With Senior's "natural state of man" as the baseline
of normality in things economic, questions of present
and future development are treated as questions of departure
from the normal, aberrations and excesses which
the theory does not aim even to account for. What is
offered in place of theoretical inquiry when these "positive
perversions of the natural forces themselves" are
-----File: 196.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\-----------
taken up (<i>e.g.</i>, in chapters xxii.-xxix.) is an exposition
of the corrections that must be made to bring the situation
back to the normal static state, and solicitous advice as to
what measures are to be taken with a view to this beneficent
end. The problem presented to Mr. Clark by the
current phenomena of economic development is: how can
it be stopped? or, failing that, how can it be guided and
minimised? Nowhere is there a sustained inquiry into
the dynamic character of the changes that have brought
the present (deplorable) situation to pass, nor into the
nature and trend of the forces at work in the development
that is going forward in this situation. None of
this is covered by Mr. Clark's use of the word "dynamic."
All that it covers in the way of theory (chapters xii.-xxi.)
is a speculative inquiry as to how the equilibrium
re√´stablished itself when one or more of the quantities involved
increases or decreases. Other than quantitive
changes are not noticed, except as provocations to homiletic
discourse. Not even the causes and the scope of
the quantitive changes that may take place in the variables
are allowed to fall within the scope of the theory of
economic dynamics.

So much of the volume, then, and of the system of doctrines
of which the volume is an exposition, as is comprised
in the later eight chapters (pp. 372-554), is an
exposition of grievances and remedies, with only sporadic
intrusions of theoretical matter, and does not properly
constitute a part of the theory, whether static or dynamic.
There is no intention here to take exception to Mr. Clark's
outspoken attitude of disapproval toward certain features
of the current business situation or to quarrel with the
remedial measures which he thinks proper and necessary.
This phase of his work is spoken of here rather to call
attention to the temperate but uncompromising tone of
-----File: 197.png---\garethrees\griff4\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
Mr. Clark's writings as a spokesman for the competitive
system, considered as an element in the Order of Nature,
and to note the fact that this is not economic theory.[6]

The theoretical section specifically scheduled as Economic
Dynamics (chapters xii.-xxi.), on the other hand,
is properly to be included under the caption of Statics.
As already remarked above, it presents a theory of equilibrium
between variables. Mr. Clark is, indeed, barred
out by his premises from any but a statical development of
theory. To realise the substantially statical character of
his Dynamics, it is only necessary to turn to his chapter
xii. (Economic Dynamics). "A highly dynamic condition,
then, is one in which the economic organism changes
rapidly and yet, at any time in the course of its changes,
is relatively near to a certain static model" (p. 196).
"The actual shape of society at any one time is not the
static model of that time; but it tends to conform to it;
and in a very dynamic society is more nearly like it than
it would be in one in which the forces of change are less
active" (p. 197). The more "dynamic" the society, the
nearer it is to the static model; until in an ideally dynamic
society, with a frictionless competitive system, to use Mr.
Clark's figure, the static state would be attained, except

[Footnote 6: What would be the scientific rating of the work of a botanist
who should spend his energy in devising ways and means to neutralize
the ecological variability of plants, or of a physiologist
who conceived it the end of his scientific endeavors to rehabilitate
the vermiform appendix or the pineal eye, or to denounce
and penalize the imitative coloring of the Viceroy butterfly?
What scientific interest would attach to the matter if Mr. Loeb,
<i>e.g.</i>, should devote a few score pages to canvassing the moral
responsibilities incurred by him in his parental relation to his
parthenogenetically developed sea-urchin eggs?

Those phenomena which Mr. Clark characterizes as "positive
perversions" may be distasteful and troublesome, perhaps, but
"the economic necessity of doing what is legally difficult" is not
of the "essentials of theory."]
-----File: 198.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\-----------
for an increase in size,--that is to say, the ideally perfect
"dynamic" state would coincide with the "static" state.
Mr. Clark's conception of a dynamic state reduces itself
to a conception of an imperfectly static state, but in such
a sense that the more highly and truly "dynamic" condition
is thereby the nearer to a static condition. Neither
the static nor the dynamic state, in Mr. Clark's view, it
should be remarked, is a state of quiescence. Both are
states of more or less intense activity, the essential difference
being that in the static state the activity goes on in
perfection, without lag, leak, or friction; the movement
of parts being so perfect as not to disturb the equilibrium.
The static state is the more "dynamic" of the two. The
"dynamic" condition is essentially a deranged static condition:
whereas the static state is the absolute perfect,
"natural" taxonomic norm of competitive life. This
dynamic-static state may vary in respect of the magnitude
of the several factors which hold one another in
equilibrium, but these are none other than quantitive variations.
The changes which Mr. Clark discusses under the
head of dynamics are all of this character,--changes in
absolute or relative magnitude of the several factors comprised
in the equation.

<tb>

But, not to quarrel with Mr. Clark's use of the terms
"static" and "dynamic," it is in place to inquire into the
merits of this class of economic science apart from any
adventitious shortcomings. For such an inquiry Mr.
Clark's work offers peculiar advantages. It is lucid, concise,
and unequivocal, with no temporising euphemisms
and no politic affectations of sentiment. Mr. Clark's
premises, and therewith the aim of his inquiry, are the
standard ones of the classical English school (including
the Jevons-Austrian wing). This school of economics
-----File: 199.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\msmoose\Hermit00\-------------
stands on the pre-evolutionary ground of normality and
"natural law," which the great body of theoretical science
occupied in the early nineteenth century. It is like
the other theoretical sciences that grew out of the rationalistic
and humitarian[** typo humanitarian?] conceptions of the eighteenth century
in that its theoretical aim is taxonomy--definition
and classification--with the purpose of subsuming its
data under a rational scheme of categories which are presumed
to make up the Order of Nature. This Order of
Nature, or realm of Natural Law, is not the actual run
of material facts, but the facts so interpreted as to meet
the needs of the taxonomist in point of taste, logical consistency,
and sense of justice. The question of the truth
and adequacy of the categories is a question as to the consensus
of taste and predilection among the taxonomists;
<i>i.e.</i>, they are an expression of trained human nature touching
the matter of what ought to be. The facts so interpreted
make up the "normal," or "natural," scheme of
things, with which the theorist has to do. His task is to
bring facts within the framework of this scheme of "natural"
categories. Coupled with this scientific purpose of
the taxonomic economist is the pragmatic purpose of finding
and advocating the expedient course of policy. On
this latter head, again, Mr. Clark is true to the animus of
the school.

The classical school, including Mr. Clark and his contemporary
associates in the science, is hedonistic and
utilitarian,--hedonistic in its theory and utilitarian in its
pragmatic ideals and endeavors. The hedonistic postulates
on which this line of economic theory is built up are
of a statical scope and character, and nothing but statical
theory (taxonomy) comes out of their development.[7]

[Footnote 7: It is a notable fact that even the genius of Herbert Spencer
could extract nothing but taxonomy from his hedonistic postu-*]*
-----File: 200.png---\Pitirim\KitFry\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
These postulates, and the theorems drawn from them,
take account of none but quantitive variations, and quantitive
variation alone does not give rise to cumulative
change, which proceeds on changes in kind.

Economics of the line represented at its best by Mr.
Clark has never entered this field of cumulative change.
It does not approach questions of the class which occupy
the modern sciences,--that is to say, questions of genesis,
growth, variation, process (in short, questions of a dynamic
import),--but confines its interest to the definition
and classification of a mechanically limited range of phenomena.
Like other taxonomic sciences, hedonistic economics
does not, and cannot, deal with phenomena of
growth except so far as growth is taken in the quantitative
sense of a variation in magnitude, bulk, mass, number,
frequency. In its work of taxonomy this economics
has consistently bound itself, as Mr. Clark does, by distinctions
of a mechanical, statistical nature, and has
drawn its categories of classification on those grounds.
Concretely, it is confined, in substance, to the determination
of and refinements upon the concepts of land, labor,
and capital, as handed down by the great economists of
the classical era, and the correlate concepts of rent, wages,
interest and profits. Solicitously, with a painfully meticulous
circumspection, the normal, mechanical metes and
bounds of these several concepts are worked out, the
touchstone of the absolute truth aimed at being the hedonistic
calculus. The facts of use and wont are not of the

*[Footnote: *lates; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>his Social Statics</i>. Spencer is both evolutionist and
hedonist, but it is only by recourse to other factors, alien to the
rational hedonistic scheme, such as habit, delusions, use and disuse,
sporadic variation, environmental forces, that he is able to
achieve anything in the way of genetic science, since it is only
by this recourse that he is enabled to enter the field of cumulative
change within which the modern post-Darwinian sciences
live and move and have their being.]
-----File: 201.png---\Pitirim\KitFry\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\--------------
essence of this mechanical refinement. These several
categories are mutually exclusive categories, mechanically
speaking. The circumstance that the phenomena covered
by them are not mechanical facts is not allowed to disturb
the pursuit of mechanical distinctions among them.
They nowhere overlap, and at the same time between
them they cover all the facts with which this economic
taxonomy is concerned. Indeed, they are in logical consistency,
required to cover them. They are hedonistically
"natural" categories of such taxonomic force that their
elemental lines of cleavage run through the facts of any
given economic situation, regardless of use and wont,
even where the situation does not permit these lines of
cleavage to be seen by men and recognised by use and
wont; so that, <i>e.g.</i>, a gang of Aleutian Islanders slushing
about in the wrack and surf with rakes and magical incantations
for the capture of shell-fish are held, in point
of taxonomic reality, to be engaged on a feat of hedonistic
equilibration in rent, wages, and interest. And that
is all there is to it. Indeed, for economic theory of this
kind, that is all there is to any economic situation. The
hedonistic magnitudes vary from one situation to another,
but, except for variations in the arithmetical details of the
hedonistic balance, all situations are, in point of economic
theory, substantially alike.[8]

Taking this unfaltering taxonomy on its own recognisances,
let us follow the trail somewhat more into the

[Footnote 8: "The capital-goods have to be taken unit by unit if their

-----File: 202.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
arithmetical details, as it leads along the narrow ridge
of rational calculation, above the tree-tops, on the levels
of clear sunlight and moonshine. For the purpose in
hand--to bring out the character of this current economic
science as a working theory of current facts, and
more particularly "as applied to modern problems of
industry and public policy" (title-page)--the sequence
to be observed in questioning the several sections into
which the theoretical structure falls is not essential. The
structure of classical theory is familiar to all students,
and Mr. Clark's redaction offers no serious departure
from the conventional lines. Such divergence from conventional
lines as may occur is a matter of details, commonly
of improvements in detail; and the revisions of detail
do not stand in such an organic relation to one another,
nor do they support and strengthen one another
in such a manner, as to suggest anything like a revolutionary
trend or a breaking away from the conventional
lines.

So as regards Mr. Clark's doctrine of Capital. It does
not differ substantially from the doctrines which are
gaining currency at the hands of such writers as Mr.
Fisher or Mr. Fetter; although there are certain formal
distinctions peculiar to Mr. Clark's exposition of the
"Capital Concept." But these peculiarities are peculiarities
of the method of arriving at the concept rather than
peculiarities substantial to the concept itself. The main
discussion of the nature of capital is contained in chapter
ii. (Varieties of Economic Goods). The conception of
capital here set forth is of fundamental consequence to
the system, partly because of the important place assigned
capital in this system of theory, partly because of the
importance which the conception of capital must have in
any theory that is to deal with problems of the current
-----File: 203.png---\Pitirim\griff4\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
(capitalistic) situation. Several classes of capital-goods
are enumerated, but it appears that in Mr. Clark's apprehension--at
variance with Mr. Fisher's view--persons
are not to be included among the items of capital. It is
also clear from the run of the argument, though not explicitly
stated, that only material, tangible, mechanically
definable articles of wealth go to make up capital. In
current usage, in the business community, "capital" is a
pecuniary concept, of course, and is not definable in mechanical
terms; but Mr. Clark, true to the hedonistic
taxonomy, sticks by the test of mechanical demarcation
and draws the lines of his category on physical
grounds; whereby it happens that any pecuniary conception
of capital is out of the question. Intangible assets,
or immaterial wealth, have no place in the theory;
and Mr. Clark is exceptionally subtle and consistent in
avoiding such modern notions. One gets the impression
that such a notion as intangible assets is conceived to
be too chimerical to merit attention, even by way of protest
or refutation.

Here, as elsewhere in Mr. Clark's writings, much is
made of the doctrine that the two facts of "capital"
and "capital-goods" are conceptually distinct, though
substantially identical. The two terms cover virtually
the same facts as would be covered by the terms "pecuniary
capital" and "industrial equipment." They are for
all ordinary purposes coincident with Mr. Fisher's terms,
"capital value" and "capital," although Mr. Clark might
enter a technical protest against identifying his categories
with those employed by Mr. Fisher.[9] "Capital is this
permanent fund of productive goods, the identity of
whose component elements is forever changing. Capital-*

[Footnote 9: <i>Cf.</i> a criticism of Mr. Fisher's conception in the <i>Political
Science Quarterly</i> for February, 1908.]
-----File: 204.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\----------
*goods are the shifting component parts of this permanent
aggregate" (p. 29). Mr. Clark admits (pp. 29-33) that
capital is colloquially spoken and thought of in terms of
value, but he insists that in point of substantial fact the
working concept of capital is (should be) that of "a fund
of productive goods," considered as an "abiding entity."
The phrase itself, "a fund of productive goods," is a
curiously confusing mixture of pecuniary and mechanical
terms, though the pecuniary expression, "a fund," is
probably to be taken in this connection as a permissible
metaphor.

This conception of capital, as a physically "abiding
entity" constituted by the succession of productive goods
that make up the industrial equipment, breaks down in
Mr. Clark's own use of it when he comes (pp. 37-38)
to speak of the mobility of capital; that is to say, so soon
as he makes use of it. A single illustration of this will
have to suffice, though there are several points in his
argument where the frailty of the conception is patent
enough. "The transfer of capital from one industry to
another is a dynamic phenomenon which is later to be
considered. What is here important is the fact that it
is in the main accomplished without entailing transfers
of capital-goods. An instrument wears itself out in one
industry, and instead of being succeeded by a like instrument
in the same industry, it is succeeded by one of a
different kind which is used in a different branch of production"
(p. 38),--illustrated on the preceding page by
a shifting of investment from a whaling-ship to a cotton-mill.
In all this it is plain that the "transfer of capital"
contemplated is a shifting of investment, and that it is,
as indeed Mr. Clark indicates, not a matter of the mechanical
shifting of physical bodies from one industry
to the other. To speak of a transfer of "capital" which
-----File: 205.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
does not involve a transfer of "capital-goods" is a contradiction
of the main position, that "capital" is made
up of "capital-goods." The continuum in which the
"abiding entity" of capital resides is a continuity of
ownership, not a physical fact. The continuity, in fact,
is of an immaterial nature, a matter of legal rights, of
contract, of purchase and sale. Just why this patent
state of the case is overlooked, as it somewhat elaborately
is, is not easily seen. But it is plain that, if the concept
of capital were elaborated from observation of current
business practice, it would be found that "capital" is a
pecuniary fact, not a mechanical one; that it is an outcome
of a valuation, depending immediately on the state
of mind of the valuers; and that the specific marks of
capital, by which it is distinguishable from other facts,
are of an immaterial character. This would, of course,
lead, directly, to the admission of intangible assets; and
this, in turn, would upset the law of the "natural" remuneration
of labor and capital to which Mr. Clark's
argument looks forward from the start. It would also
bring in the "unnatural" phenomena of monopoly as a
normal outgrowth of business enterprise.

There is a further logical discrepancy avoided by resorting
to the alleged facts of primitive industry, when
there was no capital, for the elements out of which to
construct a capital concept, instead of going to the current
business situation. In a hedonistic-utilitarian
scheme of economic doctrine, such as Mr. Clark's, only
physically productive agencies can be admitted as efficient
factors in production or as legitimate claimants to a
share in distribution. Hence capital, one of the prime
factors in production and the central claimant in the current
scheme of distribution, must be defined in physical
terms and delimited by mechanical distinctions. This is
-----File: 206.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
necessary for reasons which appear in the succeeding
chapter, on The Measure of Consumers' Wealth.

On the same page (38), and elsewhere, it is remarked
that "business disasters" destroy capital in part. The
destruction in question is a matter of values; that is to
say, a lowering of valuation, not in any appreciable degree
a destruction of material goods. Taken as a physical
aggregate, capital does not appreciably decrease
through business disasters, but, taken as a fact of ownership
and counted in standard units of value, it decreases;
there is a destruction of values and a shifting of ownership,
a loss of ownership perhaps; but these are pecuniary
phenomena, of an immaterial character, and so do
not directly affect the material aggregate of the industrial
equipment. Similarly, the discussion (pp. 301-314) of
how changes of method, as, <i>e.g.</i>, labor-saving devices,
"liberate capital," and at times "destroy" capital, is intelligible
only on the admission that "capital" here is a
matter of values owned by investors and is not employed
as a synonym for industrial appliances. The appliances
in question are neither liberated nor destroyed in
the changes contemplated. And it will not do to say
that the aggregate of "productive goods" suffers a
diminution by a substitution of devices which increases
its aggregate productiveness, as is implied, <i>e.g.</i>, by the
passage on page 3O7,[10] if Mr. Clark's definition of capital

[Footnote 10: "The machine itself is often a hopeless specialist. It can
do one minute thing and that only, and when a new and better
device appears for doing that one thing, the machine has to go,
and not to some new employment, but to the junk heap. There is
thus taking place a considerable waste of capital in consequence
of mechanical and other progress." "Indeed, a quick throwing
away of instruments which have barely begun to do their work is
often the secret of the success of an enterprising manager, but it
entails a destruction of capital."]
-----File: 207.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\hbarrass\msmoose\Hermit00\--------
is strictly adhered to. This very singular passage (pp.
306-311, under the captions, Hardships entailed on Capitalists
by Progress, and the Offset for Capital destroyed
by Changes of Method) implies that the aggregate of
appliances of production is decreased by a change which
increases the aggregate of these articles in that respect
(productivity) by virtue of which they are counted in
the aggregate. The argument will hold good if "productive
goods" are rated by bulk, weight, number, or
some such irrelevant test, instead of by their productivity
or by their consequent capitalised value. On such a
showing it should be proper to say that the polishing of
plowshares before they are sent out from the factory
diminishes the amount of capital embodied in plowshares
by as much as the weight or bulk of the waste material
removed from the shares in polishing them.

Several things may be said of the facts discussed in
this passage. There is, presumably, a decrease, in bulk,
weight, or number, of the appliances that make up the
industrial equipment at the time when such a technological
change as is contemplated takes place. This change,
presumably, increases the productive efficiency of the
equipment as a whole, and so may be said without hesitation
to increase the equipment as a factor of production,
while it may decrease it, considered as a mechanical
magnitude. The owners of the obsolete or obsolescent
appliances presumably suffer a diminution of their capital,
whether they discard the obsolete appliances or not.
The owners of the new appliances, or rather those who
own and are able to capitalise the new technological expedients,
presumably gain a corresponding advantage,
which may take the form of an increase of the effective
capitalisation of their outfit, as would then be shown by
an increased market value of their plant. The largest
-----File: 208.png---\Pitirim\griff4\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\--------------
theoretical outcome of the supposed changes, for an
economist not bound by Mr. Clark's conception of capital,
should be the generalisation that industrial capital--capital
considered as a productive agent--is substantially
a capitalisation of technological expedients, and
that a given capital invested in industrial equipment is
measured by the portion of technological expedients whose
usufruct the investment appropriates. It would accordingly
appear that the substantial core of all capital is immaterial
wealth, and that the material objects which are
formally the subject of the capitalist's ownership are, by
comparison, a transient and adventitious matter. But if
such a view were accepted, even with extreme reservations,
Mr. Clark's scheme of the "natural" distribution
of incomes between capital and labor would "go up in
the air," as the colloquial phrase has it. It would be extremely
difficult to determine what share of the value of
the joint product of capital and labor should, under a
rule of "natural" equity, go to the capitalist as an equitable
return for his monopolisation of a given portion of
the intangible assets of the community at large.[11] The
returns actually accruing to him under competitive conditions
would be a measure of the differential advantage
held by him by virtue of his having become legally
seized of the material contrivances by which the technological
achievements of the community are put into
effect.

Yet, if in this way capital were apprehended as "an
historical category," as Rodbertus would say, there is
at least the comfort in it all that it should leave a free

[Footnote 11: The position of the laborer and his wages, in this light,
would not be substantially different from that of the capitalist
and his interest. Labor is no more possible, as a fact of industry,
without the community's accumulated technological knowledge
than is the use of "productive goods."]
-----File: 209.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
field for Mr. Clark's measures of repression as applied
to the discretionary management of capital by the makers
of trusts. And yet, again, this comforting reflection
is coupled with the ugly accompaniment that by the same
move the field would be left equally free of moral obstructions
to the extreme proposals of the socialists. A safe
and sane course for the quietist in these premises should
apparently be to discard the equivocal doctrines of the
passage (pp. 306-311) from which this train of questions
arises, and hold fast to the received dogma, however unworkable,
that "capital" is a congeries of physical objects
with no ramifications or complications of an immaterial
kind, and to avoid all recourse to the concept of value,
or price, in discussing matters of modern business.

<tb>

The center of interest and of theoretical force and validity
in Mr. Clark's work is his law of "natural" distribution.
Upon this law hangs very much of the rest,
if not substantially the whole structure of theory. To
this law of distribution the earlier portions of the theoretical
development look forward, and this the succeeding
portions of the treatise take as their point of departure.
The law of "natural" distribution says that
any productive agent "naturally" gets what it produces.
Under ideally free competitive conditions--such as prevail
in the "static" state, and to which the current situation
approximates--each unit of each productive factor
unavoidably gets the amount of wealth which it creates,
--its "virtual product," as it is sometimes expressed.
This law rests, for its theoretical validity, on the doctrine
of " final productivity," set forth in full in the <i>Distribution
of Wealth</i>, and more concisely in the <i>Essentials</i>[12]--

[Footnote 12: <i>Cf. Distribution of Wealth</i>, chaps, xii, xiii, vii, viii; <i>Essentials</i>,
chaps, v-x.]
-----File: 210.png---\Pitirim\meris6\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
*"one of those universal principles which govern economic
life in all its stages of evolution."[13]

In combination with a given amount of capital, it is
held, each succeeding unit of added labor adds a less than
proportionate increment to the product. The total product
created by the labor so engaged is at the same time
the distributive share received by such labor as wages;
and it equals the increment of product added by the
"final" unit of labor, multiplied by the number of such
units engaged. The law of "natural" interest is the
same as this law of wages, with a change of terms. The
product of each unit of labor or capital being measured
by the product of the "final" unit, each gets the amount
of its own product.

In all of this the argument runs in terms of value; but
it is Mr. Clark's view, backed by an elaborate exposition
of the grounds of his contention,[14] that the use of these
terms of value is merely a matter of convenience for the
argument, and that the conclusions so reached--the
equality so established between productivity and remuneration--may
be converted to terms of goods, or "effective
utility," without abating their validity.

Without recourse to some such common denominator
as value the outcome of the argument would, as Mr.
Clark indicates, be something resembling the Ricardian
law of differential rent instead of a law drawn in homogeneous
terms of "final productivity"; and the law of
"natural" distribution would then, at the best, fall short
of a general formula. But the recourse to terms of value
does not, as Mr. Clark recognises, dispose of the question
without more ado. It smooths the way for the argument,
but, unaided, it leaves it nugatory. According to Hu-*

[Footnote 13: <i>Essentials</i>, p. 158.]

[Footnote 14: <i>Distribution</i>, chap. xxiv.]
-----File: 211.png---\Pitirim\meris6\gst\aagam\Hermit00\-------------------
*dibras, "The value of a thing Is[**is?] just as much as it will
bring," and the later refinements on the theory of value
have not set aside this dictum of the ancient authority.
It answers no pertinent question of equity to say that
the wages paid for labor are as much as it will bring.
And Mr. Clark's chapter (xxiv.) on "The Unit for
Measuring Industrial Agents and their Products" is
designed to show how this tautological statement in terms
of market value converts itself, under competitive conditions,
into a competent formula of distributive justice.
It does not conduce to intelligibility to say that the wages
of labor are just and fair because they are all that is paid
to labor as wages. What further value Mr. Clark's extended
discussion of this matter may have will lie in his
exposition of how competition converts the proposition
that "the value of a thing is just as much as it will bring"
into the proposition that "the market rate of wages (or
interest) gives to labor (or capital) the full product of
labor (or capital)."

In following up the theory at this critical point, it is
necessary to resort to the fuller statement of the <i>Distribution
of Wealth</i>,[15] the point being not so adequately covered
in the <i>Essentials</i>. Consistently hedonistic, Mr. Clark
recognises that his law of natural justice must be reduced
to elementary hedonistic terms, if it is to make good its
claim to stand as a fundamental principle of theory. In
hedonistic theory, production of course means the production
of utilities, and utility is of course utility to
the consumer.[16] A product is such by virtue of and to
the amount of the utility which it has for a consumer.
This utility of the goods is measured, as value, by the
sacrifice (disutility) which the consumer is willing to

[Footnote 15: Chap. xxiv.]

[Footnote 16: <i>Essentials</i>, p. 40.]
-----File: 212.png---\Pitirim\meris6\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
undergo in order to get the utility which the consumption
of the goods yields him. The unit and measure of productive
labor is in the last analysis also a unit of disutility;
but it is disutility to the productive laborer, not to
the consumer. The balance which establishes itself under
competitive conditions is a compound balance, being
a balance between the utility of the goods to the consumer
and the disutility (cost) which he is willing to
undergo for it, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,
a balance between the disutility of the unit of labor and
the utility for which the laborer is willing to undergo
this disutility. It is evident, and admitted, that there can
be no balance, and no commensurability, between the laborer's
disutility (pain) in producing the goods and the
consumer's utility (pleasure) in consuming them, inasmuch
as these two hedonistic phenomena lie each within
the consciousness of a distinct person. There is, in fact,
no continuity of nervous tissue over the interval between
consumer and producer, and a direct comparison, equilibrium,
equality, or discrepancy in respect of pleasure and
pain can, of course, not be sought except within each
self-balanced individual complex of nervous tissue.[17]
The wages of labor (<i>i.e.</i>, the utility of the goods received
by the laborer) is not equal to the disutility undergone
by him, except in the sense that he is competitively willing
to accept it; nor are these wages equal to the utility
got by the consumer of the goods, except in the sense

[Footnote 17: Among modern economic hedonists, including Mr. Clark,
there stands over from the better days of the order of nature a
presumption, disavowed, but often decisive, that the sensational
response to the like mechanical impact of the stimulating body is
the same in different individuals. But, while this presumption
stands ever in the background, and helps to many important conclusions,
as in the case under discussion, few modern hedonists
would question the statement in the text.]
-----File: 213.png---\Pitirim\meris6\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
that he is competitively willing to pay them. This point
is covered by the current diagrammatic arguments of
marginal-utility theory as to the determination of competitive
prices.

But, while the wages are not equal to or directly comparable
with the disutility of the productive labor engaged,
they are, in Mr. Clark's view, equal to the "productive
efficiency" of that labor.[18] "Efficiency in a
worker is, in reality, power to draw out labor on the part
of society. It is capacity to offer that for which society
will work in return." By the mediation of market price,
under competitive conditions, it is held, the laborer gets,
in his wages, a valid claim on the labor of other men
(society) as large as they are competitively willing to
allow him for the services for which he is paid his wages.
The equitable balance between work and pay contemplated
by the "natural" law is a balance between wages
and "efficiency," as above defined; that is to say, between
the wages of labor and the capacity of labor to get wages.
So far, the whole matter might evidently have been left
as Bastiat left it. It amounts to saying that the laborer
gets what he is willing to accept and the consumers give
what they are willing to pay. And this is true, of course,
whether competition prevails or not.

What makes this arrangement just and right under
competitive conditions, in Mr. Clark's view, lies in his
further doctrine that under such conditions of unobstructed
competition the prices of goods, and therefore
the wages of labor, are determined, within the scope of
the given market, by a quasi-consensus of all the parties
in interest. There is of course no formal consensus, but
what there is of the kind is implied in the fact that bargains
are made, and this is taken as an appraisement by

[Footnote 18: <i>Distribution</i>, p. 394.]
-----File: 214.png---\Pitirim\anonymo\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
"society" at large. The (quasi-) consensus of buyers is
held to embody the righteous (quasi-) appraisement of
society in the premises, and the resulting rate of wages is
therefore a (quasi-) just return to the laborer.[19] "Each
man accordingly is paid an amount that equals the total
product that he personally creates."[20] If competitive
conditions are in any degree disturbed, the equitable balance
of prices and wages is disturbed by that much. All
this holds true for the interest of capital, with a change of
terms.

The equity and binding force of this finding is evidently
bound up with that common-sense presumption on which
it rests; namely, that it is right and good that all men
should get what they can without force or fraud and
without disturbing existing property relations. It springs
from this presumption, and, whether in point of equity
or of expediency, it rises no higher than its source. It
does not touch questions of equity beyond this, nor does
it touch questions of the expediency or probable advent
of any contemplated change in the existing conventions
as to rights of ownership and initiative. It affords a basis
for those who believe in the old order--without which
belief this whole structure of opinions collapses--to
argue questions of wages and profits in a manner convincing
to themselves, and to confirm in the faith those
who already believe in the old order. But it is not easy
to see that some hundreds of pages of apparatus should
be required to find one's way back to these time-worn
commonplaces of Manchester.

In effect, this law of "natural" distribution says that

[Footnote 19: In Mr. Clark's discussion, elsewhere, the "quasi"-character
of the productive share of the laborer is indicated by saying that
it is the product "imputed" or "imputable" to him.]

[Footnote 20: <i>Essentials</i>, p. 92. Et si sensus deficit, ad firmandum cor
sincerum sola fides sufficit.]
-----File: 215.png---\Pitirim\griff4\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\---------------
whatever men acquire without force or fraud under
competitive conditions is their equitable due, no more
and no less, assuming that the competitive system, with
its underlying institution of ownership, is equitable and
"natural." In point of economic theory the law appears
on examination to be of slight consequence, but it merits
further attention for the gravity of its purport. It is
offered as a definitive law of equitable distribution comprised
in a system of hedonistic economics which is in
the main a theory of distributive acquisition only. It is
worth while to compare the law with its setting, with a
view to seeing how its broad declarations of economic
justice shows up in contrast with the elements out of
which it is constructed and among which it lies.

Among the notable chapters of the <i>Essentials</i> is one
(vi.) on Value and its Relation to Different Incomes,
which is not only a very substantial section of Mr. Clark's
economic theory, but at the same time a type of the
achievements of the latter-day hedonistic school. Certain
features of this chapter alone can be taken up here. The
rest may be equally worthy the student's attention, but
it is the intention here not to go into the general substance
of the theory of marginal utility and value, to
which the chapter is devoted, but to confine attention to
such elements of it as bear somewhat directly on the
question of equitable distribution already spoken of.
Among these latter is the doctrine of the "consumer's
surplus,"--virtually the same as what is spoken of by
other writers as "consumer's rent."[21] "Consumer's surplus"
is the surplus of utility (pleasure) derived by the
consumer of goods above the (pain) cost of the goods to
him. This is held to be a very generally prevalent phenomenon.
Indeed, it is held to be all but universally

[Footnote 21: See pp. 102-113; also p. 172, note.]
-----File: 216.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
present in the field of consumption. It might, in fact, be
effectively argued that even Mr. Clark's admitted exception[22]
is very doubtfully to be allowed, on his own showing.
Correlated with this element of utility on the consumer's
side is a similar volume of disutility on the producer's
side, which may be called "producer's abatement,"
or "producer's rent": it is the amount of disutility
by which the disutility-cost of a given article to
any given producer (laborer) falls short of (or conceivably
exceeds) the disutility incurred by the marginal
producer. Marginal buyers or consumers and marginal
sellers or producers are relatively few: the great body
on both sides come in for something in the way of a
"surplus" of utility or disutility.

All this bears on the law of "natural" wages and interest
as follows, taking that law of just remuneration
at Mr. Clark's rating of it. The law works out through
the mediation of price. Price is determined, competitively,
by marginal producers or sellers and marginal
consumers or purchasers: the latter alone on the one
side get the precise price-equivalent of the disutility incurred
by them, and the latter alone on the other side
pay the full price-equivalent of the utilities derived by
them from the goods purchased.[23] Hence the competitive
price--covering competitive wages and interest--does
not reflect the consensus of all parties concerned as
to the "effective utility" of the goods, on the one hand,
or as to their effective (disutility) cost, on the other hand.
It reflects instead, if anything of this kind, the valuations
which the marginal unfortunates on each side concede
under stress of competition; and it leaves on each side
of the bargain relation an uncovered "surplus," which

[Footnote 22: "The cheapest and poorest grades of articles." Page 113.[**Internal ref.?]]

[Footnote 23: See p. 113.[**Internal ref.?]]
-----File: 217.png---\Pitirim\teresagz\macaw89\msmoose\Hermit00\-----------
marks the (variable) interval by which price fails to
cover "effective utility." The excess utility--and the
conceivable excess cost--does not appear in the market
transactions that mediate between consumer and producer.[24]
In the balance, therefore, which establishes
itself in terms of value between the social utility of the
product and the remuneration of the producer's "efficiency,"
the margin of utility represented by the aggregate
"consumer's surplus" and like elements is not
accounted for. It follows, when the argument is in
this way reduced to its hedonistic elements, that no man
"is paid an amount that equals the amount of the total
product that he personally creates."

Supposing the marginal-utility (final-utility) theories
of objective value to be true, there is no consensus, actual
or constructive, as to the "effective utility" of the goods
produced: there is no "social" decision in the case beyond
what may be implied in the readiness of buyers to
profit as much as may be by the necessities of the marginal
buyer and seller. It appears that there is warrant, within
these premises, for the formula: Remuneration ^[** Seems to convey the meaning "is always either greater or less than." I don't know how to insert that character.] than
Product. Only by an infinitesimal chance would it hold
true in any given case that, hedonistically, Remuneration
= Product; and, if it should ever happen to be true,
there would be no finding it out.

The (hedonistic) discrepancy which so appears between
remuneration and product affects both wages and
interest in the same manner, but there is some (hedonistic)
ground in Mr. Clark's doctrines for holding that the
discrepancy does not strike both in the same degree.

[Footnote 24: The disappearance, and the method of disapearance[** disappearance?], of such
elements of differential utility and disutility occupies a very
important place in all marginal-utility ("final-utility") theories
of market value, or "objective value."]
-----File: 218.png---\armei\Pitirim\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\----------------
There is indeed no warrant for holding that there is anything
like an equable distribution of this discrepancy
among the several industries or the several industrial
concerns; but there appears to be some warrant, on Mr.
Clark's argument, for thinking that the discrepancy is
perhaps slighter in those branches of industry which produce
the prime necessaries of life.[25] This point of doctrine
throws also a faint (metaphysical) light on a,
possibly generic, discrepancy between the remuneration
of capitalists and that of laborers: the latter are, relatively,
more addicted to consuming the necessaries of life,
and it may be that they thereby gain less in the way of
a consumer's surplus.

All the analysis and reasoning here set forth has an air
of undue tenuity; but in extenuation of this fault it
should be noted that this reasoning is made up of such
matter as goes to make up the theory under review, and
the fault, therefore, is not to be charged to the critic.
The manner of argument required to meet this theory of
the "natural law of final productivity" on its own ground
is itself a sufficiently tedious proof of the futility of the
whole matter in dispute. Yet it seems necessary to beg
further indulgence for more of the same kind. As a
needed excuse, it may be added that what immediately
follows bears on Mr. Clark's application of the law of
"natural distribution" to modern problems of industry
and public policy, in the matter of curbing monopolies.

<tb>

Accepting, again, Mr. Clark's general postulates--the
postulates of current hedonistic economics--and applying
the fundamental concepts, instead of their corollaries,
to his scheme of final productivity, it can be shown

[Footnote 25: "Only the simplest and cheapest things that are sold in the
market at all bring just what they are worth to the buyers."
Page 113.]
-----File: 219.png---\Birdman\Pitirim\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
to fail on grounds even more tenuous and hedonistically
more fundamental than those already passed in review.
In all final-utility (marginal-utility) theory it is of the
essence of the scheme of things that successive increments
of a "good" have progressively less than proportionate
utility. In fact, the coefficient of decrease of utility
is greater than the coefficient of increase of the stock of
goods. The solitary "first loaf" is exorbitantly useful.
As more loaves are successively added to the stock, the
utility of each grows small by degrees and incontinently
less, until, in the end, the state of the "marginal" or
"final" loaf is, in respect of utility, shameful to relate.
So, with a change of phrase, it fares with successive increments
of a given productive factor--labor or capital--in
Mr. Clark's scheme of final productivity. And so,
of course, it also fares with the utility of successive increments
of product created by successively adding unit
after unit to the complement of a given productive factor
engaged in the case. If we attend to this matter of final
productivity in consistently hedonistic terms, a curious
result appears.

A larger complement of the productive agent, counted
by weight and tale, will, it is commonly held, create
a larger output of goods, counted by weight and tale;[26]
but these are not hedonistic terms and should not be
allowed to cloud the argument. In the hedonistic scheme
the magnitude of goods, in all the dimensions to be taken

[Footnote 26: It is, <i>e.g.</i>, open to serious question whether Mr. Clark's
curves of final productivity (pp. 139, 148), showing a declining
output per unit in response to an increase of one of the complementary
agents of production, will fit the common run of
industry in case the output be counted by weight and tale. In
many cases they will, no doubt; in many other cases they will not.
But this is no criticism of the curves in question, since they do
not, or at least should not, purport to represent the product in
such terms, but in terms of utility.]
-----File: 220.png---\hsnitch\teresagz\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
account of, is measured in terms of utility, which is a
different matter from weight and tale. It is by virtue of
their utility that they are "goods," not by virtue of their
physical dimensions, number and the like; and utility
is a matter of the production of pleasure and the prevention
of pain. Hedonistically speaking, the amount
of the goods, the magnitude of the output, is the quantity
of utility derivable from their consumption; and the
utility per unit decreases faster than the number of units
increases.[27] It follows that in the typical or undifferentiated
case an increase of the number of units beyond a
certain critical point entails a decrease of the "total effective
utility" of the supply.[28] This critical point seems
ordinarily to be very near the point of departure of the
curve of declining utility, perhaps it frequently coincides
with the latter. On the curve of declining final
utility, at any point whose tangent cuts the axis of ordinates
at an angle of less than 45 degrees, an increase of
the number of units entails a decrease of the "total effective
utility of the supply,"[29] so that a gain in physical

[Footnote 27: To resort to an approximation after the manner of Malthus,
if the supply of goods be supposed to increase by arithmetical
progression, their final utility may be said concomitantly to decrease
by geometrical progression.]

[Footnote 28: <i>Cf. Essentials</i>, chap. iii, especially pp. 40-41.]

[Footnote 29: The current marginal-utility diagrams are not of much use in
this connection, because the angle of the tangent with the axis of
ordinates, at any point, is largely a matter of the draftsman's
taste. The abscissa and the ordinate do not measure commensurable
units. The units on the abscissa are units of frequency,
while those on the ordinate are units of amplitude; and
the greater or less segment of line allowed per unit on either axis
is a matter of independently arbitrary choice. Yet the proposition
in the text remains true,--as true as hedonistic propositions
commonly are. The magnitude of the angle of the tangent with
the axis of ordinates decides whether the total (hedonistic) productivity
at a given point in the curve increases or decreases with
a (mechanical) increase of the productive agent,--no student at]*
-----File: 221.png---\Chmwilliams\teresagz\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\---------
productivity is a loss as counted in " total effective utility."
Hedonistically, therefore, the productivity in such
a case diminishes, not only relatively to the (physical)
magnitude of the productive agents, but absolutely. This
critical point, of maximum "total effective utility," is, if
the practice of shrewd business men is at all significant,
commonly somewhat short of the point of maximum
physical productivity, at least in modern industry and in
a modern community.

The "total effective utility" may commonly be increased
by decreasing the output of goods. The "total
effective utility" of wages may often be increased by
decreasing the amount (value) of the wages per man,
particularly if such a decrease is accompanied by a rise
in the price of articles to be bought with the wages.
Hedonistically speaking, it is evident that the point of
maximum net productivity is the point at which a perfectly
shrewd business management of a perfect monopoly
would limit the supply; and the point of maximum (hedonistic)
remuneration (wages and interest) is the point
which such a management would fix on in dealing with
a wholly free, perfectly competitive supply of labor and
capital.

Such a monopolistic state of things, it is true, would
not answer to Mr. Clark's ideal. Each man would not be
"paid an amount that equals the amount of the total
product that he personally creates," but he would commonly
be paid an amount that (hedonistically, in point
of "effective utility") exceeds what he personally creates,
because of the high final utility of what he receives.

*[Footnote: all familiar with marginal-utility arguments will question that
patent fact. But the angle of the tangent depends on the fancy of
the draftsman,--no one possessed of the elemental mathematical
notions will question[**Not sure if √≥ or a mistake] that equally patent fact.]
-----File: 222.png---\eyeread\teresagz\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
This is easily proven. Under the monopolistic conditions
supposed, the laborers would, it is safe to assume, not be
fully employed all the time; that is to say, they would be
willing to work some more in order to get some more
articles of consumption; that is to say, the articles of consumption
which their wages offer them have so high a
utility as to afford them a consumer's surplus,--the
articles are worth more than they cost:[30] <sc>Q. E. D.</sc>

The initiated may fairly doubt the soundness of the
chain of argument by which these heterodox theoretical
results are derived from Mr. Clark's hedonistic postulates,
more particularly since the adepts of the school, including
Mr. Clark, are not accustomed to draw conclusions to
this effect from these premises. Yet the argument proceeds
according to the rules of marginal-utility permutations.
In view of this scarcely avoidable doubt, it may
be permitted, even at the risk of some tedium, to show
how the facts of every-day life bear out this unexpected
turn of the law of natural distribution, as briefly traced
above. The principle involved is well and widely accepted.
The familiar practical maxim of "charging
what the traffic will bear" rests on a principle of this
kind, and affords one of the readiest practical illustrations
of the working of the hedonistic calculus. The
principle involved is that a larger aggregate return
(value) may be had by raising the return per unit to such
a point as to somewhat curtail the demand. In practice
it is recognised, in other words, that there is a critical
point at which the value obtainable per unit, multiplied
by the number of units that will be taken off at that price,
will give the largest net aggregate result (in value to the

[Footnote 30: A similar line of argument has been followed up by Mr.
Clark for capital and interest, in a different connection. See
<i>Essentials</i>, pp. 340-345, 356.]
-----File: 223.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\macaw89\A. B. Dahl\Hermit00\--
seller) obtainable under the given conditions. A calculus
involving the same principle is, of course, the guiding
consideration in all monopolistic buying and selling; but
a moment's reflection will show that it is, in fact, the
ruling principle in all commercial transactions and, indeed,
in all business. The maxim of "charging what the
traffic will bear" is only a special formulation of the
generic principle of business enterprise. Business initiative,
the function of the entrepreneur (business man) is
comprehended under this principle taken in its most
general sense.[31] In business the buyer, it is held by
the theorists, bids up to the point of greatest obtainable
advantage to himself under the conditions prevailing, and
the seller similarly bids down to the point of greatest
obtainable net aggregate gain. For the trader (business
man, entrepreneur) doing business in the open (competitive)
market or for the business concern with a partial
or limited monopoly, the critical point above referred
to is, of course, reached at a lower point on the curve of
price than would be the case under a perfect and unlimited
monopoly, such as was supposed above; but the
principle of charging what the traffic will bear remains
intact, although the traffic will not bear the same in the
one case as in the other.

Now, in the theories based on marginal (or "final")
utility, value is an expression or measure of "effective
utility"--or whatever equivalent term may be preferred.
In operating on values, therefore, under the rule of charging
what the traffic will bear, the sellers of a monopolised
supply, <i>e.g.</i>, must operate through the valuations of the
buyers; that is to say, they must influence the final
utility of the goods or services to such effect that the

[Footnote 31: <i>Cf. Essentials</i>, pp. 83-90, 118-120.]
-----File: 224.png---\eyeread\marcel dijkers\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----
"total effective utility" of the limited supply to the
consumers will be greater than would be the "total effective
utility" of a larger supply, which is the point in
question. The emphasis falls still more strongly on this
illustration of the hedonistic calculus, if it is called to
mind that in the common run of such limitations of supply
by a monopolistic business management the management
would be able to increase the supply at a progressively
declining cost beyond the critical point by virtue
of the well-known principle of increasing returns from
industry. It is also to be added that, since the monopolistic
business gets its enhanced return from the margin
by which the "total effective utility" of the limited supply
exceeds that of a supply not so limited, and since
there is to be deducted from this margin the costs of
monopolistic management in addition to other costs, therefore
the enhancement of the "total effective utility" of
the goods to the consumer in the case must be appreciably
larger than the resulting net gains to the monopoly.

By a bold metaphor--a metaphor sufficiently bold to
take it out of the region of legitimate figures of speech--the
gains that come to enterprising business concerns
by such monopolistic enhancement of the "total effective utility"
of their products are spoken of as "robbery,"
"extortion," "plunder"; but the theoretical complexion
of the case should not be overlooked by the hedonistic
theorist in the heat of outraged sentiment. The monopolist
is only pushing the principle of all business enterprise
(free competition) to its logical conclusion; and, in point
of hedonistic theory, such monopolistic gains are to be
accounted the "natural" remuneration of the monopolist
for his "productive" service to the community in enhancing
their enjoyment per unit of consumable goods
-----File: 225.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----
to such point as to swell their net aggregate enjoyment
to a maximum.

This intricate web of hedonistic calculations might be
pursued further, with the result of showing that, while
the consumers of the monopolised supply of goods are
gainers by virtue of the enhanced "total effective utility"
of the goods, the monopolists who bring about this result
do so in great part at their own cost, counting cost in
terms of a reduction of "total effective utility." By
injudiciously increasing their own share of goods, they
lower the marginal and effective utility of their wealth
to such a point as, probably, to entail a considerable
(hedonistic) privation in the shrinkage of their enjoyment
per unit. But it is not the custom of economists, nor
does Mr. Clark depart from this custom, to dwell on the
hardships of the monopolists. This much may be added,
however, that this hedonistically consistent exposition of
the "natural law of final productivity" shows it to be
"one of those universal principles which govern economic
life in all its stages of evolution," even when that evolution
enters the phase of monopolistic business enterprise,--granting
always the sufficiency of the hedonistic postulates
from which the law is derived. Further, the considerations
reviewed above go to show that, on two counts,
Mr. Clark's crusade against monopoly in the later portion
of his treatise is out of touch with the larger theoretical
speculations of the earlier portions: (<i>a</i>) it runs counter
to the hedonistic law of "natural" distribution; and (<i>b</i>)
the monopolistic business against which Mr. Clark speaks
is but the higher and more perfect development of that
competitive business enterprise which he wishes to reinstate,--competitive
business, so called, being incipiently
monopolistic enterprise.
-----File: 226.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\-------

Apart from this theoretical bearing, the measures which
Mr. Clark advocates for the repression of monopoly, under
the head of applications "to modern problems of
industry and public policy," may be good economic policy
or they may not,--they are the expression of a sound
common sense, an unvitiated solicitude for the welfare
of mankind, and a wide information as to the facts of
the situation. The merits of this policy of repression, as
such, cannot be discussed here. On the other hand, the
relation of this policy to the theoretical groundwork of
the treatise needs also not be discussed here, inasmuch
as it has substantially no relation to the theory. In this
later portion of the volume Mr. Clark does not lean on
doctrines of "final utility," "final productivity," or, indeed,
on hedonistic economics at large. He speaks eloquently
for the material and cultural interests of the
community, and the references to his law of "natural
distribution" might be cut bodily out of the discussion
without lessening the cogency of his appeal or exposing
any weakness in his position. Indeed, it is by no means
certain that such an excision would not strengthen his
appeal to men's sense of justice by eliminating irrelevant
matter.

Certain points in this later portion of the volume, however,
where the argument is at variance with specific articles
of theory professed by Mr. Clark, may be taken up,
mainly to elucidate the weakness of his theoretical position
at the points in question. He recognises with more
than the current degree of freedom that the growth and
practicability of monopolies under modern conditions
is chiefly due to the negotiability of securities representing
capital, coupled with the joint-stock character of modern
business concerns.[32] These features of the modern

[Footnote 32: <i>Cf.</i> chap. xxii, especially pp. 378-392.]
-----File: 227.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----
(capitalistic) business situation enable a sufficiently few
men to control a section of the community sufficiently
large to make an effective monopoly. The most effective
known form of organisation for purposes of monopoly,
according to Mr. Clark, is that of the holding company,
and the ordinary corporation follows it closely in effectiveness
in this respect. The monopolistic control is effected
by means of the vendible securities covering the
capital engaged. To meet the specifications of Mr.
Clark's theory of capital, these vendible securities--as
<i>e.g.</i>, the securities (common stock) of a holding company--should
be simply the formal evidence of the ownership
of certain productive goods and the like. Yet, by his
own showing, the ownership of a share of productive
goods proportionate to the face value, or the market value,
of the securities is by no means the chief consequence of
such an issue of securities.[33] One of the consequences,
and for the purposes of Mr. Clark's argument the gravest
consequence, of the employment of such securities,
is the dissociation of ownership from the control of the
industrial equipment, whereby the owners of certain securities,
which stand in certain immaterial, technical relations
to certain other securities, are enabled arbitrarily
to control the use of the industrial equipment covered by
the latter. These are facts of the modern organisation
of capital, affecting the productivity of the industrial
equipment and its serviceability both to its owners and
to the community. They are facts, though not physically
tangible objects; and they have an effect on the serviceability
of industry no less decisive than the effect which
any group of physically tangible objects of equal market
value have. They are, moreover, facts which are bought
and sold in the purchase and sale of these securities, as,

[Footnote 33: <i>Cf.</i> p. 391.]
-----File: 228.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
<i>e.g.</i>, the common stock of a holding company. They have a
value, and therefore they have a "total effective utility."

In short, these facts are intangible assets, which are
the most consequential element in modern capital, but
which have no existence in the theory of capital by which
Mr. Clark aims to deal with "modern problems of industry."
Yet, when he comes to deal with these problems,
it is, of necessity, these intangible assets that immediately
engage his attention. These intangible assets are an outgrowth
of the freedom of contract under the conditions
imposed by the machine industry; yet Mr. Clark proposes
to suppress this category of intangible assets without
prejudice to freedom of contract or to the machine industry,
apparently without having taken thought of the lesson
which he rehearses (pp. 390-391) from the introduction
of the holding company, with its "sinister perfection,"
to take the place of the (less efficient) "trust"
when the latter was dealt with somewhat as it is now
proposed to deal with the holding company. One is
tempted to remark that a more na√Øve apprehension of
the facts of modern capital would have afforded a more
competent realisation of the problems of monopoly.

<tb>

It appears from what has just been said of Mr. Clark's
"natural" distribution and of his dealing with the problems
of modern industry that the logic of hedonism is of
no avail for the theory of business affairs. Yet it is held,
perhaps justly, that the hedonistic interpretation may be
of great avail in analysing the industrial functions of the
community, in their broad, generic character, even if it
should not serve so well for the intricate details of the
modern business situation. It may be at least a serviceable
hypothesis for the outlines of economic theory, for
the first approximations to the "economic laws" sought
-----File: 229.png---\Chmwilliams\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-
by taxonomists. To be serviceable for this purpose, the
hypothesis need perhaps not be true to fact, at least not
in the final details of the community's life or without
material qualification;[34] but it must at least have that
ghost of actuality that is implied in consistency with its
own corollaries and ramifications.

As has been suggested in an earlier paragraph, it is
characteristic of hedonistic economics that the large and
central element in its theoretical structure is the doctrine
of distribution. Consumption being taken for granted
as a quantitive[** quantitative ??] matter simply,--essentially a matter of
an insatiable appetite,--economics becomes a theory of
acquisition; production is, theoretically, a process of acquisition,
and distribution a process of distributive acquisition.
The theory of production is drawn in terms of
the gains to be acquired by production; and under competitive
conditions this means necessarily the acquisition
of a distributive share of what is available. The rest of
what the facts of productive industry include, as, <i>e.g.</i>, the
facts of workmanship or the " state of the industrial arts,"
gets but a scant and perfunctory attention. Those matters
are not of the theoretical essence of the scheme. Mr.
Clark's general theory of production does not differ substantially
from that commonly professed by the marginal-utility
school. It is a theory of competitive acquisition.
An inquiry into the principles of his doctrine, therefore,
as they appear, <i>e.g.</i>, in the early chapters of the <i>Essentials</i>,
is, in effect, an inquiry into the competence of the
main theorems of modern hedonistic economics.

"All men seek to get as much net service from material
wealth as they can." "Some of the benefit received is
neutralised by the sacrifice incurred; but there is a net
surplus of gains not thus canceled by sacrifices, and the

[Footnote 34: <i>Cf. Essentials</i>, p. 39.]
-----File: 230.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
generic motive which may properly be called economic
is the desire to make this surplus large."[35] It is of the
essence of the scheme that the acquisitive activities of
mankind afford a net balance of pleasure. It is out of
this net balance, presumably, that "the consumer's surpluses"
arise, or it is in this that they merge. This optimistic
conviction is a matter of presumption, of course;
but it is universally held to be true by hedonistic economists,
particularly by those who cultivate the doctrines of
marginal utility. It is not questioned and not proven. It
seems to be a surviving remnant of the eighteenth-century
faith in a benevolent Order of Nature; that is to say, it
is a rationalistic metaphysical postulate. It may be true
or not, as matter of fact; but it is a postulate of the school,
and its optimistic bias runs like a red thread through all
the web of argument that envelops the "normal" competitive
system. A surplus of gain is normal to the theoretical
scheme.

The next great theorem of this theory of acquisition
is at cross-purposes with this one. Men get useful goods
only at the cost of producing them, and production is
irksome, painful, as has been recounted above. They go
on producing utilities until, at the margin, the last increment
of utility in the product is balanced by the concomitant
increment of disutility in the way of irksome
productive effort,--labor or abstinence. At the margin,
pleasure-gain is balanced by pain-cost. But the "effective
utility" of the total product is measured by that of
the final unit; the effective utility of the whole is given
by the number of units of product multiplied by the
effective utility of the final unit; while the effective disutility
(pain-cost) of the whole is similarly measured by
the pain-cost of the final unit. The "total effective

[Footnote 35: <i>Essentials</i>, p. 39.]
-----File: 231.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------
utility" of the producer's product equals the "total effective
disutility" of his pains of acquisition. Hence
there is no net surplus of utility in the outcome.

The corrective objection is ready to hand,[36] that, while
the balance of utility and disutility holds at the margin,
it does not hold for the earlier units of the product, these
earlier units having a larger utility and a lower cost, and
so leaving a large net surplus of utility, which gradually
declines as the margin is approached. But this attempted
correction evades the hedonistic test. It shifts the ground
from the calculus to the objects which provoke the calculation.
Utility is a psychological matter, a matter of
pleasurable appreciation, just as disutility, conversely, is
a matter of painful appreciation. The individual who
is held to count the costs and the gain in this hedonistic
calculus is, by supposition, a highly reasonable person.
He counts the cost to him as an individual against
the gain to him as an individual. He looks before and
after, and sizes the whole thing up in a reasonable course
of conduct. The "absolute utility" would exceed the
"effective utility" only on the supposition that the "producer"
is an unreflecting sensory apparatus, such as the
beasts of the field are supposed to be, devoid of that gift
of appraisement and calculation which is the hypothetical
hedonist's only human trait. There might on such a
supposition--if the producer were an intelligent sensitive
organism simply--emerge an excess of total pleasure
over total pain, but there could then be no talk of utility
or of disutility, since these terms imply intelligent reflection,
and they are employed because they do so. The
hedonistic producer looks to his own cost and gain, as an
intelligent pleasure-seeker whose consciousness compasses
the contrasted elements as wholes. He does not contrast

[Footnote 36: <i>Cf. Essentials</i>, chap. iii, especially pp. 51-56.]
-----File: 232.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
the balance of pain and pleasure in the morning with the
balance of pain and pleasure in the afternoon, and say
that there is so much to the good because he was not so
tired in the morning. Indeed, by hypothesis, the pleasure
to be derived from the consumption of the product is
a future, or expected, pleasure, and can be said to be present,
at the point of time at which a given unit of pain-cost
is incurred, only in anticipation; and it cannot be
said that the anticipated pleasure attaching to a unit of
product which emerges from the effort of the producer
during the relatively painless first hour's work exceeds
the anticipated pleasure attaching to a similar unit emerging
from the second hour's work. Mr. Clark has, in effect,
explained this matter in substantially the same way
in another connection (<i>e.g.</i>, p. 42), where he shows that
the magnitude on which the question of utility and cost
hinges is the "total effective utility," and that the "total
absolute utility" is a matter not of what hedonistically is,
in respect of utility as an outcome of production, but of
what might have been under different circumstances.

An equally unprofitable result may be reached from
the same point of departure along a different line of argument.
Granting that increments of product should be
measured, in respect of utility, by comparison with the
disutility of the concomitant increment of cost, then the
diagrammatic arguments commonly employed are inadequate,
in that the diagrams are necessarily drawn in
two dimensions only,--length and breadth: whereas they
should be drawn in three dimensions, so as to take account
of the intensity of application as well as of its duration.[37]

[Footnote 37: This difficulty is recognized by the current marginal-utility
arguments, and an allowance for intensity is made or presumed.
But the allowance admitted is invariably insufficient. It might be
said to be insufficient by hypothesis, since it is by hypothesis too
small to offset the factor which it is admitted to modify.]
-----File: 233.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
Apparently, the exigencies of graphic representation, fortified
by the presumption that there always emerges a
surplus of utility, have led marginal-utility theorists, in
effect, to overlook this matter of intensity of application.

When this element is brought in with the same freedom
as the other two dimensions engaged, the argument will,
in hedonistic consistency, run somewhat as follows,--the
run of the facts being what it may. The producer, setting
out on this irksome business, and beginning with the
production of the exorbitantly useful initial unit of product,
will, by hedonistic necessity, apply himself to the
task with a correspondingly extravagant intensity, the
irksomeness (disutility) of which necessarily rises to such
a pitch as to leave no excess of utility in this initial unit
of product above the concomitant disutility of the initial
unit of productive effort.[38] As the utility of subsequent
units of product progressively declines, so will the producer's
intensity of irksome application concomitantly
decline, maintaining a nice balance between utility and
disutility throughout. There is, therefore, no excess of
"absolute utility" above "effective utility" at any point
on the curve, and no excess of "total absolute utility"
above "total effective utility" of the product as a whole,
nor above the "total absolute disutility" or the "total
effective disutility" of the pain-cost.

A transient evasion of this outcome may perhaps be
sought by saying that the producer will act wisely, as a

[Footnote 38: The limit to which the intensity rises is a margin of the same
kind as that which limits the duration. This supposition, that
the intensity of application necessarily rises to such a pitch that
its disutility overtakes and offsets the utility of the product, may
be objected to as a bit of puerile absurdity; but it is a long
time since puerility or absurdity has been a bar to any supposition
in arguments on marginal utility.]
-----File: 234.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------
good hedonist should, and save his energies during the
earlier moments of the productive period in order to
get the best aggregate result from his day's labor, instead
of spending himself in ill-advised excesses at the outset.
Such seems to be the fact of the matter, so far as the
facts wear a hedonistic complexion; but this correction
simply throws the argument back on the previous position
and concedes the force of what was there claimed.
It amounts to saying that, instead of appreciating each
successive unit of product in isolated contrast with its concomitant
unit of irksome productive effort, the producer,
being human, wisely looks forward to his total product
and rates it by contrast with his total pain-cost. Whereupon,
as before, no net surplus of utility emerges, under
the rule which says that irksome production of utilities
goes on until utility and disutility balance.

But this revision of "final productivity" has further
consequences for the optimistic doctrines of hedonism.
Evidently, by a somewhat similar line of argument the
"consumer's surplus" will be made to disappear, even
as this that may be called the "producer's surplus" has
disappeared. Production being acquisition, and the consumer's
cost being cost of acquisition, the argument above
should apply to the consumer's case without abatement.
On considering this matter in terms of the hedonistically
responsive individual concerned, with a view to determining
whether there is, in his calculus of utilities
and costs, any margin of uncovered utilities left over
after he has incurred all the disutilities that are worth
while to him,--instead of proceeding on a comparison
between the pleasure-giving capacity of a given article
and the market price of the article, all such alleged
differential advantages within the scope of a single sensory
-----File: 235.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
are seen to be nothing better than an illusory diffractive
effect due to a faulty instrument.

But the trouble does not end here. The equality:
pain-cost = pleasure-gain, is not a competent formula.
It should be: pain-cost incurred = pleasure-gain anticipated.
And between these two formulas lies the old
adage, "there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip."
In an appreciable proportion of ventures, endeavors, and
enterprises, men's expectations of pleasure-gain are in
some degree disappointed,--through miscalculation,
through disserviceable secondary effects of their productive
efforts, by "the act of God," by "fire, flood, and pestilence."
In the nature of things these discrepancies fall
out on the side of loss more frequently than on that of
gain. After all allowance has been made for what may
be called serviceable errors, there remains a margin of
disserviceable error, so that pain-cost > eventual pleasure-gain
= anticipated pleasure-gain -- <i>n.</i> Hence, in general,
pain-cost > pleasure-gain. Hence it appears that, in the
nature of things, men's pains of production are underpaid
by that much; although it may, of course, be held that
the nature of things at this point is not "natural" or
"normal."

To this it may be objected that the risk is discounted.
Insurance is a practical discounting of risk; but insurance
is resorted to only to cover risk that is appreciated by the
person exposed to it, and it is such risks as are not appreciated
by those who incur them that are chiefly in
question here. And it may be added that insurance has
hitherto not availed to equalise and distribute the chances
of success and failure. Business gains--enterpreneur's[** entrepreneur?]
gains, the rewards of initiative and enterprise--come out
of this uncovered margin of adventure, and the losses
-----File: 236.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
of initiative and enterprise are to be set down to the same
account. In some measure this element of initiative and
enterprise enters into all economic endeavor. And it is
not unusual for economists to remark that the volume
of unsuccessful or only partly successful enterprise is
very large. There are some lines of enterprise that are,
as one might say, extra hazardous, in which the average
falls out habitually on the wrong side of the account.
Typical of this class is the production of the precious
metals, particularly as conducted under that r√©gime of
free competition for which Mr. Clark speaks. It has been
the opinion, quite advisedly, of such economists of the
classic age of competition as J. S. Mill and Cairnes, <i>e.g.</i>,
that the world's supply of the precious metals has been
got at an average or total cost exceeding their value by
several fold. The producers, under free competition at
least, are over-sanguine of results.

But, in strict consistency, the hedonistic theory of human
conduct does not allow men to be guided in their
calculation of cost and gain, when they have to do with
the precious metals, by different norms from those which
rule their conduct in the general quest of gain. The
visible difference in this respect between the production
of the precious metals and production generally should
be due to the larger proportions and greater notoriety
of the risks in this field rather than to a difference in the
manner of response to the stimulus of expected gain.
The canons of hedonistic calculus permit none but a
quantitative difference in the response. What happens
in the production of the precious metals is typical of
what happens in a measure and more obscurely throughout
the field of productive effort.

Instead of a surplus of utility of product above the
disutility of acquisition, therefore, there emerges an
-----File: 237.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
average or aggregate net hedonistic deficit. On a consistent
marginal-utility theory, all production is a losing
game. The fact that Nature keeps the bank, it appears,
does not take the hedonistic game of production out of
the general category known of old to that class of sanguine
hedonistic calculators whose day-dreams are filled
with safe and sane schemes for breaking the bank.
"Hope springs eternal in the human breast." Men are
congenitally over-sanguine, it appears; and the production
of utilities is, mathematically speaking, a function of
the pig-headed optimism of mankind. It turns out that
the laws of (human) nature malevolently grind out vexation
for men instead of benevolently furthering the greatest
happiness of the greatest number. The sooner the
whole traffic ceases, the better,--the smaller will be the
net balance of pain. The great hedonistic Law of Nature
turns out to be simply the curse of Adam, backed
by the even more sinister curse of Eve.

<tb>

The remark was made in an earlier paragraph that Mr.
Clark's theories have substantially no relation to his
practical proposals. This broad declaration requires an
equally broad qualification. While the positions reached
in his theoretical development count for nothing in making
or fortifying the positions taken on "problems of
modern industry and public policy," the two phases of
the discussion--the theoretical and the pragmatic--are
the outgrowth of the same range of preconceptions and
run back to the same metaphysical ground. The present
canvass of items in the doctrinal system has already far
overpassed reasonable limits, and it is out of the question
here to pursue the exfoliation of ideas through
Mr. Clark's discussion of public questions, even in the
fragmentary fashion in which scattered items of the
-----File: 238.png---\Pitirim\Ymartin\hbarrass\msmoose\Hermit00\-----------
theoretical portion of his treatise have been passed in
review. But a broad and rudely drawn characterisation
may yet be permissible. This latter portion of the
volume has the general complexion of a Bill of Rights.
This is said, of course, with no intention of imputing a
fault. It implies that the scope and method of the discussion
is governed by the preconception that there is
one right and beautiful definitive scheme of economic
life, "to which the whole creation tends." Whenever
and in so far as current phenomena depart or diverge
from this definitive "natural" scheme or from the
straight and narrow path that leads to its consummation,
there is a grievance to be remedied by putting the wheels
back into the rut. The future, such as it ought to be,--the
only normally possible, natural future scheme of life,--is
known by the light of this preconception; and men
have an indefeasible right to the installation and maintenance
of those specific economic relations, expedients,
institutions, which this "natural" scheme comprises, and
to no others. The consummation is presumed to dominate
the course of things which is presumed to lead up
to the consummation. The measures of redress whereby
the economic Order of Nature is to renew its youth are
simple, direct, and short-sighted, as becomes the proposals
of pre-Darwinian hedonism, which is not troubled
about the exuberant uncertainties of cumulative
change. No doubt presents itself but that the community's
code of right and equity in economic matters
will remain unchanged under changing conditions of economic
life.

THE LIMITATIONS OF MARGINAL UTILITY[1]


The limitations of the marginal-utility economics are
sharp and characteristic. It is from first to last a doctrine
of value, and in point of form and method it is a
theory of valuation. The whole system, therefore, lies
within the theoretical field of distribution, and it has but
a secondary bearing on any other economic phenomena
than those of distribution--the term being taken in its
accepted sense of pecuniary distribution, or distribution
in point of ownership. Now and again an attempt is
made to extend the use of the principle of marginal utility
beyond this range, so as to apply it to questions of
production, but hitherto without sensible effect, and necessarily
so. The most ingenious and the most promising of
such attempts have been those of Mr. Clark, whose work
marks the extreme range of endeavor and the extreme degree
of success in so seeking to turn a postulate of distribution
to account for a theory of production. But the
outcome has been a doctrine of the production of values,
and value, in Mr. Clark's as in other utility systems, is a
matter of valuation; which throws the whole excursion
back into the field of distribution. Similarly, as regards
attempts to make use of this principle in an analysis of
the phenomena of consumption, the best results arrived
at are some formulation of the pecuniary distribution of
consumption goods.

Within this limited range marginal-utility theory is of a

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from the <i>Journal of Political Economy</i>,
Vol. XVII, No. 9 November 1909.]
-----File: 240.png---\Pitirim\amerisca\macaw89\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
wholly statical character. It offers no theory of a movement
of any kind, being occupied with the adjustment of
values to a given situation. Of this, again, no more convincing
illustration need be had than is afforded by the
work of Mr. Clark, which is not excelled in point of earnestness,
perseverance, or insight. For all their use of
the term "dynamic," neither Mr. Clark nor any of his
associates in this line of research have yet contributed
anything at all appreciable to a theory of genesis, growth,
sequence, change, process, or the like, in economic life.
They have had something to say as to the bearing which
given economic changes, accepted as premises, may have
on valuation, and so on distribution; but as to the causes
of change or the unfolding sequence of the phenomena of
economic life they have had nothing to say hitherto; nor
can they, since their theory is not drawn in causal terms
but in terms of teleology.

In all this the marginal-utility school is substantially at
one with the classical economics of the nineteenth century,
the difference between the two being that the former
is confined within narrower limits and sticks more consistently
to its teleological premises. Both are teleological,
and neither can consistently admit arguments from
cause to effect in the formulation of their main articles of
theory. Neither can deal theoretically with phenomena
of change, but at the most only with rational adjustment
to change which may be supposed to have supervened.

To the modern scientist the phenomena of growth and
change are the most obtrusive and most consequential
facts observable in economic life. For an understanding
of modern economic life the technological advance of the
past two centuries--<i>e.g.</i>, the growth of the industrial
arts--is of the first importance; but marginal-utility the-*
-----File: 241.png---\Pitirim\jcricket\macaw89\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*ory does not bear on this matter, nor does this matter bear
on marginal-utility theory. As a means of theoretically
accounting for this technological movement in the past or
in the present, or even as a means of formally, technically
stating it as an element in the current economic situation,
that doctrine and all its works are altogether idle. The
like is true for the sequence of change that is going forward
in the pecuniary relations of modern life; the hedonistic
postulate and its propositions of differential utility
neither have served nor can serve an inquiry into these
phenomena of growth, although the whole body of marginal-utility
economics lies within the range of these pecuniary
phenomena. It has nothing to say to the growth
of business usages and expedients or to the concomitant
changes in the principles of conduct which govern the
pecuniary relations of men, which condition and are conditioned
by these altered relations of business life or
which bring them to pass.

It is characteristic of the school that wherever an element
of the cultural fabric, an institution or any institutional
phenomenon, is involved in the facts with which the
theory is occupied, such institutional facts are taken for
granted, denied, or explained away. If it is a question of
price, there is offered an explanation of how exchanges
may take place with such effect as to leave money and
price out of the account. If it is a question of credit, the
effect of credit extension on business traffic is left on one
side and there is an explanation of how the borrower and
lender co√∂perate to smooth out their respective income
streams of consumable goods or sensations of consumption.
The failure of the school in this respect is consistent
and comprehensive. And yet these economists are
lacking neither in intelligence nor in information. They
are, indeed, to be credited, commonly, with a wide range
-----File: 242.png---\Darkseas\meris6\macaw89\JackieB\K7UQT\---------------
of information and an exact control of materials, as well
as with a very alert interest in what is going on; and
apart from their theoretical pronouncements the members
of the school habitually profess the sanest and most intelligent
views of current practical questions, even when
these questions touch matters of institutional growth and
decay.

The infirmity of this theoretical scheme lies in its postulates,
which confine the inquiry to generalisations of the
teleological or "deductive" order. These postulates, together
with the point of view and logical method that follow
from them, the marginal-utility school shares with
other economists of the classical line--for this school is
but a branch or derivative of the English classical economists
of the nineteenth century. The substantial difference
between this school and the generality of classical
economists lies mainly in the fact that in the marginal-utility
economics the common postulates are more consistently
adhered to at the same time that they are more
neatly defined and their limitations are more adequately
realized. Both the classical school in general and its specialized
variant, the marginal-utility school, in particular,
take as their common point of departure the traditional
psychology of the early nineteenth-century hedonists,
which is accepted as a matter of course or of common
notoriety and is held quite uncritically. The central and
well-defined tenet so held is that of the hedonistic calculus.
Under the guidance of this tenet and of the other
psychological conceptions associated and consonant with
it, human conduct is conceived of and interpreted as a
rational response to the exigencies of the situation in
which mankind is placed; as regards economic conduct it
is such a rational and unprejudiced response to the stimulus
of anticipated pleasure and pain--being, typically
-----File: 243.png---\Pitirim\meris6\hbarrass\JackieB\K7UQT\---------------
and in the main, a response to the promptings of anticipated
pleasure, for the hedonists of the nineteenth century
and of the marginal-utility school are in the main
of an optimistic temper.[2] Mankind is, on the whole and
normally, (conceived to be) clearsighted and farsighted
in its appreciation of future sensuous gains and losses, although
there may be some (inconsiderable) difference
between men in this respect. Men's activities differ,
therefore, (inconsiderably) in respect of the alertness of
the response and the nicety of adjustment of irksome
pain-cost to apprehended future sensuous gain; but, on the
whole, no other ground or line or guidance of conduct
than this rationalistic calculus falls properly within the
cognizance of the economic hedonists. Such a theory can
take account of conduct only in so far as it is rational
conduct, guided by deliberate and exhaustively intelligent
choice--wise adaptation to the demands of the main
chance.

The external circumstances which condition conduct
are variable, of course, and so they will have a varying
effect upon conduct; but their variation is, in effect, construed
to be of such a character only as to vary the degree
of strain to which the human agent is subject by contact
with these external circumstances. The cultural elements
involved in the theoretical scheme, elements that

[Footnote 2: The conduct of mankind differs from that of the brutes in being
determined by anticipated sensations of pleasure and pain,
instead of actual sensations. Hereby, in so far, human conduct
is taken out of the sequence of cause and effect and falls instead
under the rule of sufficient reason. By virtue of this rational
faculty in man the connection between stimulus and response
is teleological instead of causal.

The reason for assigning the first and decisive place to pleasure,
rather than to pain, in the determination of human conduct,
appears to be the (tacit) acceptance of that optimistic doctrine
of a beneficent order of nature which the nineteenth century inherited
from the eighteenth.]
-----File: 244.png---\Pitirim\meris6\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
are of the nature of institutions, human relations governed
by use and wont in whatever kind and connection,
are not subject to inquiry but are taken for granted as
pre-existing in a finished, typical form and as making up a
normal and definitive economic situation, under which
and in terms of which human intercourse is necessarily
carried on. This cultural situation comprises a few
large and simple articles of institutional furniture, together
with their logical implications or corollaries; but
it includes nothing of the consequences or effects caused
by these institutional elements. The cultural elements so
tacitly postulated as immutable conditions precedent to
economic life are ownership and free contract, together
with such other features of the scheme of natural rights
as are implied in the exercise of these. These cultural
products are, for the purpose of the theory, conceived to
be given a priori in unmitigated force. They are part of
the nature of things; so that there is no need of accounting
for them or inquiring into them, as to how they have
come to be such as they are, or how and why they have
changed and are changing, or what effect all this may
have on the relations of men who live by or under this
cultural situation.

Evidently the acceptance of these immutable premises,
tacitly, because uncritically and as a matter of course, by
hedonistic economics gives the science a distinctive character
and places it in contrast with other sciences whose
premises are of a different order. As has already been
indicated, the premises in question, so far as they are
peculiar to the hedonistic economics, are (<i>a</i>) a certain institutional
situation, the substantial feature of which is
the natural right of ownership, and (<i>b</i>) the hedonistic
calculus. The distinctive character given to this system
of theory by these postulates and by the point of view
-----File: 245.png---\Darkseas\meris6\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
resulting from their acceptance may be summed up
broadly and concisely in saying that the theory is confined
to the ground of sufficient reason instead of proceeding
on the ground of efficient cause. The contrary is
true of modern science, generally (except mathematics),
particularly of such sciences as have to do with the phenomena
of life and growth. The difference may seem
trivial. It is serious only in its consequences. The two
methods of inference--from sufficient reason and from
efficient cause--are out of touch with one another and
there is no transition from one to the other: no method of
converting the procedure or the results of the one into
those of the other. The immediate consequence is that
the resulting economic theory is of a teleological character--"deductive"
or "a priori" as it is often called--instead
of being drawn in terms of cause and effect. The
relation sought by this theory among the facts with which
it is occupied is the control exercised by future (apprehended)
events over present conduct. Current phenomena
are dealt with as conditioned by their future consequences;
and in strict marginal-utility theory they can be
dealt with only in respect of their control of the present
by consideration of the future. Such a (logical) relation
of control or guidance between the future and the
present of course involves an exercise of intelligence, a
taking thought, and hence an intelligent agent through
whose discriminating forethought the apprehended future
may affect the current course of events; unless, indeed,
one were to admit something in the way of a providential
order of nature or some occult line of stress of the nature
of sympathetic magic. Barring magical and providential
elements, the relation of sufficient reason runs by way of
the interested discrimination, the forethought, of an agent
who takes thought of the future and guides his present
-----File: 246.png---\Pitirim\meris6\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
activity by regard for this future. The relation of sufficient
reason runs only from the (apprehended) future
into the present, and it is solely of an intellectual, subjective,
personal, teleological character and force; while the
relation of cause and effect runs only in the contrary direction,
and it is solely of an objective, impersonal, materialistic
character and force. The modern scheme of
knowledge, on the whole, rests, for its definitive ground,
on the relation of cause and effect; the relation of sufficient
reason being admitted only provisionally and as a
proximate factor in the analysis, always with the unambiguous
reservation that the analysis must ultimately
come to rest in terms of cause and effect. The merits
of this scientific animus, of course, do not concern the
present argument.

Now, it happens that the relation of sufficient reason
enters very substantially into human conduct. It is this
element of discriminating forethought that distinguishes
human conduct from brute behavior. And since the
economist's subject of inquiry is this human conduct,
that relation necessarily comes in for a large share of
his attention in any theoretical formulation of economic
phenomena, whether hedonistic or otherwise. But while
modern science at large has made the causal relation the
sole ultimate ground of theoretical formulation; and
while the other sciences that deal with human life admit
the relation of sufficient reason as a proximate, supplementary,
or intermediate ground, subsidiary, and subservient
to the argument from cause to effect; economics has
had the misfortune--as seen from the scientific point of
view--to let the former supplant the latter. It is, of
course, true that human conduct is distinguished from
other natural phenomena by the human faculty for taking
thought, and any science that has to do with human
-----File: 247.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
conduct must face the patent fact that the details of such
conduct consequently fall into the teleological form; but
it is the peculiarity of the hedonistic economics that by
force of its postulates its attention is confined to this teleological
bearing of conduct alone. It deals with this conduct
only in so far as it may be construed in rationalistic,
teleological terms of calculation and choice. But it is at
the same time no less true that human conduct, economic
or otherwise, is subject to the sequence of cause and
effect, by force of such elements as habituation and conventional
requirements. But facts of this order, which
are to modern science of graver interest than the teleological
details of conduct, necessarily fall outside the attention
of the hedonistic economist, because they cannot be
construed in terms of sufficient reason, such as his postulates
demand, or be fitted into a scheme of teleological
doctrines.

There is, therefore, no call to impugn these premises of
the marginal-utility economics within their field. They
commend themselves to all serious and uncritical persons
at the first glance. They are principles of action which
underlie the current, business-like scheme of economic
life, and as such, as practical grounds of conduct, they are
not to be called in question without questioning the existing
law and order. As a matter of course, men order
their lives by these principles and, practically, entertain
no question of their stability and finality. That is what
is meant by calling them institutions; they are settled
habits of thought common to the generality of men. But
it would be mere absentmindedness in any student of civilization
therefore to admit that these or any other human
institutions have this stability which is currently imputed
to them or that they are in this way intrinsic to the nature
of things. The acceptance by the economists of these or
-----File: 248.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
other institutional elements as given and immutable limits
their inquiry in a particular and decisive way. It
shuts off the inquiry at the point where the modern scientific
interest sets in. The institutions in question are
no doubt good for their purpose as institutions, but they
are not good as premises for a scientific inquiry into the
nature, origin, growth, and effects of these institutions
and of the mutations which they undergo and which they
bring to pass in the community's scheme of life.

To any modern scientist interested in economic phenomena,
the chain of cause and effect in which any given
phase of human culture is involved, as well as the cumulative
changes wrought in the fabric of human conduct
itself by the habitual activity of mankind, are matters
of more engrossing and more abiding interest than the
method of inference by which an individual is presumed
invariably to balance pleasure and pain under given conditions
that are presumed to be normal and invariable.
The former are questions of the life-history of the race
or the community, questions of cultural growth and of
the fortunes of generations; while the latter is a question
of individual casuistry in the face of a given situation that
may arise in the course of this cultural growth. The
former bear on the continuity and mutations of that
scheme of conduct whereby mankind deals with its material
means of life; the latter, if it is conceived in hedonistic
terms, concerns a disconnected episode in the sensuous
experience of an individual member of such a community.

In so far as modern science inquires into the phenomena
of life, whether inanimate, brute, or human, it is
occupied about questions of genesis and cumulative
change, and it converges upon a theoretical formulation in
the shape of a life-history drawn in causal terms. In so
-----File: 249.png---\Darkseas\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\---
far as it is a science in the current sense of the term,
any science, such as economics, which has to do with
human conduct, becomes a genetic inquiry into the human
scheme of life; and where, as in economics, the subject of
inquiry is the conduct of man in his dealings with the material
means of life, the science is necessarily an inquiry
into the life-history of material civilization, on a more or
less extended or restricted plan. Not that the economist's
inquiry isolates material civilization from all other
phases and bearings of human culture, and so studies
the motions of an abstractly conceived "economic man."
On the contrary, no theoretical inquiry into this material
civilization that shall be at all adequate to any scientific
purpose can be carried out without taking this material
civilization in its causal, that is to say, its genetic, relations
to other phases and bearings of the cultural complex;
without studying it as it is wrought upon by other
lines of cultural growth and as working its effects in these
other lines. But in so far as the inquiry is economic science,
specifically, the attention will converge upon the
scheme of material life and will take in other phases of
civilization only in their correlation with the scheme of
material civilization.

Like all human culture this material civilization is a
scheme of institutions--institutional fabric and institutional
growth. But institutions are an outgrowth of
habit. The growth of culture is a cumulative sequence of
habituation, and the ways and means of it are the habitual
response of human nature to exigencies that vary incontinently,
cumulatively, but with something of a consistent
sequence in the cumulative variations that so go
forward,--incontinently, because each new move creates
a new situation which induces a further new variation
in the habitual manner of response; cumulatively, because
-----File: 250.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
each new situation is a variation of what has gone before
it and embodies as causal factors all that has been effected
by what went before; consistently, because the underlying
traits of human nature (propensities, aptitudes, and what
not) by force of which the response takes place, and on
the ground of which the habituation takes effect, remain
substantially unchanged.

Evidently an economic inquiry which occupies itself exclusively
with the movements of this consistent, elemental
human nature under given, stable institutional conditions--such
as is the case with the current hedonistic economics--can
reach statical results alone; since it makes
abstraction from those elements that make for anything
but a statical result. On the other hand an adequate theory
of economic conduct, even for statical purposes, cannot
be drawn in terms of the individual simply--as is
the case in the marginal-utility economics--because it
cannot be drawn in terms of the underlying traits of
human nature simply; since the response that goes to
make up human conduct takes place under institutional
norms and only under stimuli that have an institutional
bearing; for the situation that provokes and inhibits action
in any given case is itself in great part of institutional,
cultural derivation. Then, too, the phenomena of
human life occur only as phenomena of the life of a group
or community: only under stimuli due to contact with the
group and only under the (habitual) control exercised
by canons of conduct imposed by the group's scheme of
life. Not only is the individual's conduct hedged about
and directed by his habitual relations to his fellows in
the group, but these relations, being of an institutional
character, vary as the institutional scheme varies. The
wants and desires, the end and aim, the ways and means,
the amplitude and drift of the individual's conduct are
-----File: 251.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
functions of an institutional variable that is of a highly
complex and wholly unstable character.

The growth and mutations of the institutional fabric
are an outcome of the conduct of the individual members
of the group, since it is out of the experience of
the individuals, through the habituation of individuals,
that institutions arise; and it is in this same experience
that these institutions act to direct and define the aims and
end of conduct. It is, of course, on individuals that the
system of institutions imposes those conventional standards,
ideals, and canons of conduct that make up the community's
scheme of life. Scientific inquiry in this field,
therefore, must deal with individual conduct and must
formulate its theoretical results in terms of individual
conduct. But such an inquiry can serve the purposes of
a genetic theory only if and in so far as this individual
conduct is attended to in those respects in which it counts
toward habituation, and so toward change (or stability)
of the institutional fabric, on the one hand, and in those
respects in which it is prompted and guided by the received
institutional conceptions and ideals on the other
hand. The postulates of marginal utility, and the hedonistic
preconceptions generally, fail at this point in that
they confine the attention to such bearings of economic
conduct as are conceived not to be conditioned by habitual
standards and ideals and to have no effect in the way
of habituation. They disregard or abstract from the
causal sequence of propensity and habituation in economic
life and exclude from theoretical inquiry all such
interest in the facts of cultural growth, in order to attend
to those features of the case that are conceived to be
idle in this respect. All such facts of institutional force
and growth are put on one side as not being germane to
pure theory; they are to be taken account of, if at all, by
-----File: 252.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
afterthought, by a more or less vague and general allowance
for inconsequential disturbances due to occasional
human infirmity. Certain institutional phenomena, it is
true, are comprised among the premises of the hedonists,
as has been noted above; but they are included as postulates
a priori. So the institution of ownership is taken
into the inquiry not as a factor of growth or an element
subject to change, but as one of the primordial and immutable
facts of the order of nature, underlying the hedonistic
calculus. Property, ownership, is presumed as
the basis of hedonistic discrimination and it is conceived
to be given in its finished (nineteenth-century) scope and
force. There is no thought either of a conceivable
growth of this definitive nineteenth-century institution
out of a cruder past or of any conceivable cumulative
change in the scope and force of ownership in the present
or future. Nor is it conceived that the presence of this
institutional element in men's economic relations in any
degree affects or disguises the hedonistic calculus, or that
its pecuniary conceptions and standards in any degree
standardize, color, mitigate, or divert the hedonistic calculator
from the direct and unhampered quest of the net
sensuous gain. While the institution of property is included
in this way among the postulates of the theory, and
is even presumed to be ever-present in the economic
situation, it is allowed to have no force in shaping economic
conduct, which is conceived to run its course to its
hedonistic outcome as if no such institutional factor intervened
between the impulse and its realization. The
institution of property, together with all the range of pecuniary
conceptions that belong under it and that cluster
about it, are presumed to give rise to no habitual or conventional
canons of conduct or standards of valuation, no
-----File: 253.png---\Darkseas\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\---
proximate ends, ideals, or aspirations. All pecuniary notions
arising from ownership are treated simply as expedients
of computation which mediate between the pain-cost
and the pleasure-gain of hedonistic choice, without
lag, leak, or friction; they are conceived simply as the
immutably correct, God-given notation of the hedonistic
calculus.

The modern economic situation is a business situation,
in that economic activity of all kinds is commonly controlled
by business considerations. The exigencies of
modern life are commonly pecuniary exigencies. That is
to say they are exigencies of the ownership of property.
Productive efficiency and distributive gain are both rated
in terms of price. Business considerations are considerations
of price, and pecuniary exigencies of whatever kind
in the modern communities are exigencies of price. The
current economic situation is a price system. Economic
institutions in the modern civilized scheme of life are
(prevailingly) institutions of the price system. The accountancy
to which all phenomena of modern economic
life are amenable is an accountancy in terms of price; and
by the current convention there is no other recognized
scheme of accountancy, no other rating, either in law or
in fact, to which the facts of modern life are held amenable.
Indeed, so great and pervading a force has this
habit (institution) of pecuniary accountancy become
that it extends, often as a matter of course, to many facts
which properly have no pecuniary bearing and no pecuniary
magnitude, as, <i>e.g.</i>, works of art, science, scholarship,
and religion. More or less freely and fully, the
price system dominates the current commonsense in its
appreciation and rating of these non-pecuniary ramifications
of modern culture; and this in spite of the fact that,
-----File: 254.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------
on reflection, all men of normal intelligence will freely
admit that these matters lie outside the scope of pecuniary
valuation.

Current popular taste and the popular sense of merit
and demerit are notoriously affected in some degree by pecuniary
considerations. It is a matter of common notoriety,
not to be denied or explained away, that pecuniary
("commercial ") tests and standards are habitually made
use of outside of commercial interests proper. Precious
stones, it is admitted, even by hedonistic economists, are
more esteemed than they would be if they were more plentiful
and cheaper. A wealthy person meets with more
consideration and enjoys a larger measure of good repute
than would fall to the share of the same person with the
same habit of mind and body and the same record of
good and evil deeds if he were poorer. It may well be
that this current "commercialisation" of taste and appreciation
has been overstated by superficial and hasty critics
of contemporary life, but it will not be denied that
there is a modicum of truth in the allegation. Whatever
substance it has, much or little, is due to carrying over
into other fields of interest the habitual conceptions induced
by dealing with and thinking of pecuniary matters.
These "commercial" conceptions of merit and demerit
are derived from business experience. The pecuniary
tests and standards so applied outside of business transactions
and relations are not reducible to sensuous terms of
pleasure and pain. Indeed, it may, <i>e.g.</i>, be true, as is
commonly believed, that the contemplation of a wealthy
neighbor's pecuniary superiority yields painful rather
than pleasurable sensations as an immediate result; but it
is equally true that such a wealthy neighbor is, on the
whole, more highly regarded and more considerately
treated than another neighbor who differs from the for-*
-----File: 255.png---\Darkseas\Ymartin\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
*mer only in being less enviable in respect of wealth.

It is the institution of property that gives rise to these
habitual grounds of discrimination, and in modern times,
when wealth is counted in terms of money, it is in terms
of money value that these tests and standards of pecuniary
excellence are applied. This much will be admitted.
Pecuniary institutions induce pecuniary habits of thought
which affect men's discrimination outside of pecuniary
matters; but the hedonistic interpretation alleges that
such pecuniary habits of thought do not affect men's discrimination
in pecuniary matters. Although the institutional
scheme of the price system visibly dominates the
modern community's thinking in matters that lie outside
the economic interest, the hedonistic economists insist, in
effect, that this institutional scheme must be accounted of
no effect within that range of activity to which it owes its
genesis, growth, and persistence. The phenomena of business,
which are peculiarly and uniformly phenomena of
price, are in the scheme of the hedonistic theory reduced
to non-pecuniary hedonistic terms and the theoretical formulation
is carried out as if pecuniary conceptions had no
force within the traffic in which such conceptions originate.
It is admitted that preoccupation with commercial
interests has "commercialised" the rest of modern life,
but the "commercialisation" of commerce is not admitted.
Business transactions and computations in pecuniary
terms, such as loans, discounts, and capitalisation,
are without hesitation or abatement converted into terms
of hedonistic utility, and conversely.

It may be needless to take exception to such conversion
from pecuniary into sensuous terms, for the theoretical
purpose for which it is habitually made; although, if
need were, it might not be excessively difficult to show
that the whole hedonistic basis of such a conversion is a
-----File: 256.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
psychological misconception. But it is to the remoter
theoretical consequences of such a conversion that exception
is to be taken. In making the conversion abstraction
is made from whatever elements do not lend themselves
to its terms; which amounts to abstracting from
precisely those elements of business that have an institutional
force and that therefore would lend themselves to
scientific inquiry of the modern kind--those (institutional)
elements whose analysis might contribute to an
understanding of modern business and of the life of the
modern business community as contrasted with the assumed
primordial hedonistic calculus.

The point may perhaps be made clearer. Money and
the habitual resort to its use are conceived to be simply
the ways and means by which consumable goods are acquired,
and therefore simply a convenient method by
which to procure the pleasurable sensations of consumption;
these latter being in hedonistic theory the sole and
overt end of all economic endeavor. Money values have
therefore no other significance than that of purchasing
power over consumable goods, and money is simply an
expedient of computation. Investment, credit extensions,
loans of all kinds and degrees, with payment of interest
and the rest, are likewise taken simply as intermediate
steps between the pleasurable sensations of consumption
and the efforts induced by the anticipation of these sensations,
other bearings of the case being disregarded.
The balance being kept in terms of the hedonistic consumption,
no disturbance arises in this pecuniary traffic so
long as the extreme terms of this extended hedonistic
equation--pain-cost and pleasure-gain--are not altered,
what lies between these extreme terms being merely algebraic
notation employed for convenience of accountancy.
But such is not the run of the facts in modern business.
-----File: 257.png---\Pitirim\amerisca\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
Variations of capitalization, <i>e.g.</i>, occur without its being
practicable to refer them to visibly equivalent variations
either in the state of the industrial arts or in the sensations
of consumption. Credit extensions tend to inflation
of credit, rising prices, overstocking of markets, etc.,
likewise without a visible or securely traceable correlation
in the state of the industrial arts or in the pleasures of
consumption; that is to say, without a visible basis in
those material elements to which the hedonistic theory
reduces all economic phenomena. Hence the run of the
facts, in so far, must be thrown out of the theoretical
formulation. The hedonistically presumed final purchase
of consumable goods is habitually not contemplated
in the pursuit of business enterprise. Business men habitually
aspire to accumulate wealth in excess of the limits
of practicable consumption, and the wealth so accumulated
is not intended to be converted by a final transaction
of purchase into consumable goods or sensations of consumption.
Such commonplace facts as these, together
with the endless web of business detail of a like pecuniary
character, do not in hedonistic theory raise a question as
to how these conventional aims, ideals, aspirations, and
standards have come into force or how they affect the
scheme of life in business or outside of it; they do not
raise those questions because such questions cannot be
answered in the terms which the hedonistic economists
are content to use, or, indeed, which their premises permit
them to use. The question which arises is how to explain
the facts away: how theoretically to neutralize them
so that they will not have to appear in the theory, which
can then be drawn in direct and unambiguous terms of
rational hedonistic calculation. They are explained away
as being aberrations due to oversight or lapse of memory
on the part of business men, or to some failure of logic or
-----File: 258.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
insight. Or they are construed and interpreted into the
rationalistic terms of the hedonistic calculus by resort to
an ambiguous use of the hedonistic concepts. So that the
whole "money economy," with all the machinery of credit
and the rest, disappears in a tissue of metaphors to reappear
theoreticaly[** theoretically?] expurgated, sterilized, and simplified
into a "refined system of barter," culminating in a net aggregate
maximum of pleasurable sensations of consumption.

But since it is in just this unhedonistic, unrationalistic
pecuniary traffic that the tissue of business life consists;
since it is this peculiar conventionalism of aims and standards
that differentiates the life of the modern business
community from any conceivable earlier or cruder phase
of economic life; since it is in this tissue of pecuniary intercourse
and pecuniary concepts, ideals, expedients, and
aspirations that the conjunctures of business life arise and
run their course of felicity and devastation; since it is
here that those institutional changes take place which distinguish
one phase or era of the business community's
life from any other; since the growth and change of these
habitual, conventional elements make the growth and
character of any business era or business community; any
theory of business which sets these elements aside or explains
them away misses the main facts which it has gone
out to seek. Life and its conjunctures and institutions
being of this complexion, however much that state of the
case may be deprecated, a theoretical account of the
phenomena of this life must be drawn in these terms in
which the phenomena occur. It is not simply that the
hedonistic interpretation of modern economic phenomena
is inadequate or misleading; if the phenomena are subjected
to the hedonistic interpretation in the theoretical
analysis they disappear from the theory; and if they
-----File: 259.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
would bear the interpretation in fact they would disappear
in fact. If, in fact, all the conventional relations and
principles of pecuniary intercourse were subject to such a
perpetual rationalized, calculating revision, so that each
article of usage, appreciation, or procedure must approve
itself <i>de novo</i> on hedonistic grounds of sensuous expediency
to all concerned at every move, it is not conceivable
that the institutional fabric would last over night.

GUSTAV SCHMOLLER'S ECONOMICS[1]


Professor Schmoller's <i>Grundriss</i>[2] is an event of the
first importance in economic literature. It appears from
later advices that the second and concluding volume of
the work is hardly to be looked for at as early a date
as the author's expressions in his preface had led us to
anticipate. What lies before Professor Schmoller's readers,
therefore, in this first volume of the <i>Outlines</i> is but
one-half of the compendious statement which he here
purposes making of his theoretical position and of his
views and exemplification of the scope and method of
economic science. It may accordingly seem adventurous
to attempt a characterisation of his economic system on
the basis of this avowedly incomplete statement. And
yet such an endeavor is not altogether gratuitous, nor need
it in any great measure proceed on hypothetical grounds.
The introduction comprised in the present volume sketches
the author's aim in an outline sufficiently full to afford a
convincing view of the "system" of science for which he
speaks; and the two books by which the introduction is
followed show Professor Schmoller's method of inquiry
consistently carried out, as well as the reach and nature
of the theoretical conclusions which he considers to lie
within the competency of economic science. And with
regard to an economist who is so much of an innovator,--not
to say so much of an iconoclast,--and whose work

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>,
Vol. XVI, Nov., 1901.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre</i>. Erster
Teil. Leipzig, 1900.]
-----File: 261.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\hbarrass\A. B. Dahl\Hermit00\----------
touches the foundations of the science so intimately and
profoundly, the interest of his critics and associates must,
at least for the present, center chiefly about these questions
as to the scope and nature assigned to the theory by
his discussion, as to the range and character of the material
of which he makes use, and as to the methods of
inquiry which his sagacity and experience commend. So,
therefore, while the <i>Outlines</i> is yet incomplete, considered
as a compendium of details of doctrine, the work in its
unfinished state need not thereby be an inadequate expression
of Professor Schmoller's relation to economic
science.

Herewith for the first time economic readers are put in
possession of a fully advised deliverance on economic
science at large as seen and cultivated by that modernised
historical school of which Professor Schmoller is the
authoritative exponent. Valuable and characteristic as
his earlier discussions on the scope and method of the
science are, they are but preliminary studies and tentative
formulations as compared with this maturer work, which
not only avows itself a definitive formulation, but has
about it an air of finality perceptible at every turn. But
this comes near saying that it embodies the sole comprehensive
working-out of the scientific aims of the historical
school. Discussions partially covering the field,
monographs and sketches there are in great number,
showing the manner of economic theory that was to be
looked for as an outcome of the "historical diversion."
Some of these, especially some of the later ones, are extremely
valuable in the results they offer, as well as
significant of the trend which the science is taking under
the hands of the German students.[3] But a comprehen-*

[Footnote 3: <i>E.g.</i>, K. B√ºcher's <i>Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft</i>, and <i>Arbeit
und Rythmus</i>; R. Hildebrand's <i>Recht und Sitte</i>; Knapp's <i>Grund-</i>*]*
-----File: 262.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
*sive work, aiming to formulate a body of economic
theory on the basis afforded by the "historical method,"
has not hitherto been seriously attempted.

To the broad statement just made exception might
perhaps be taken in favor of Schaeffle's half-forgotten
work of the seventies, together possibly with several other
less notable and less consistent endeavors of a similar
kind, dating back to the early decades of the school.
Probably none of the younger generation of economists
would be tempted to cite Roscher's work as invalidating
such a statement as the one made above. Although time
has been allowed for the acceptance and authentication of
these endeavors of the earlier historical economists in the
direction of a system of economic theory,--that is to say,
of an economic science,--they have failed of authentication
at the hands of the students of the science; and there
seems no reason to regard this failure as less than definitive.

During the last two decades the historical school has
branched into two main directions of growth, somewhat
divergent, so that broad general statements regarding the
historical economists can be less confidently made to-day
than perhaps at any earlier time. Now, as regards the
more conservative branch, the historical economists of the
stricter observance,--these modern continuers of what
may be called the elder line of the historical school can
scarcely be said to cultivate a science at all, their aim
being not theoretical work. Assuredly, the work of this
elder line, of which Professor Wagner is the unquestioned
head, is by no means idle. It is work of a sufficiently
important and valuable order, perhaps it is indispensable
to the task which the science has in hand, but, broadly

*[Footnote: *<i>herrschaft und Rittergut</i>; Ehrenberg's <i>Zeitalter der Fugger</i>; R.
Mucke's various works.]
-----File: 263.png---\Pitirim\ianh44\gst\aagam\Hermit00\-------------------
speaking, it need not be counted with in so far as it
touches directly upon economic theory. This elder line
of German economics, in its numerous modern representatives,
shows both insight and impartiality; but as regards
economic theory their work bears the character of
eclecticism rather than that of a constructive advance.
Frequent and peremptory as their utterances commonly
are on points of doctrine, it is only very rarely that these
utterances embody theoretical views arrived at or verified
by the economists who make them or by such methods of
inquiry as are characteristic of these economists. Where
these expressions of doctrine are not of the nature of
maxims of expediency, they are, as is well known, commonly
borrowed somewhat uncritically from classical
sources. Of constructive scientific work--that is to say,
of theory--this elder line of German economics is innocent;
nor does there seem to be any prospect of an eventual
output of theory on the part of that branch of the
historical school, unless they should unexpectedly take
advice, and make the scope, and therefore the method, of
their inquiry something more than historical in the sense
in which that term is currently accepted. The historical
economics of the conservative kind seems to be a barren
field in the theoretical respect.

So that whatever characteristic articles of general
theory the historical school may enrich the science with
are to be looked for at the hands of those men who, like
Professor Schmoller, have departed from the strict
observance of the historical method. A peculiar interest,
therefore, attaches to his work as the best accepted
and most authoritative spokesman of that branch of historical
economics which professes to cultivate theoretical
inquiry. It serves to show in what manner and degree
this more scientific wing of the historical school have out-*
-----File: 264.png---\Pitirim\ianh44\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
*grown the original "historical" standpoint and range of
conceptions, and how they have passed from a distrust of
all economic theory to an eager quest of theoretical formulations
that shall cover all phenomena of economic life
to better purpose than the body of doctrine received from
the classical writers and more in consonance with the
canons of contemporary science at large. That this
should have been the outcome of the half-century of
development through which the school has now passed
might well seem unexpected, if not incredible, to any who
saw the beginning of that divergence within the school,
a generation ago, out of which this modernised, theoretical
historical economics has arisen.

Professor Schmoller entered the field early, in the
sixties, as a protestant against the aims and ideals then
in vogue in economics. His protest ran not only against
the methods and results of the classical writers, but also
against the views professed by the leaders of the historical
school, both as regards the scope of the science
and as regards the character of the laws or generalisations
sought by the science. His early work, in so
far as he was at variance with his colleagues, was chiefly
critical; and there is no good evidence that he then had
a clear conception of the character of that constructive
work to which it has been his persistent aim to
turn the science. Hence he came to figure in common repute
as an iconoclast and an extreme exponent of the historical
school, in that he was held practically to deny the
feasibility of a scientific treatment of economic matters
and to aim at confining economics to narrative, statistics,
and description. This iconoclastic or critical phase of his
economic discussion is now past, and with it the uncertainty
as to the trend and outcome of his scientific activity.
-----File: 265.png---\Pitirim\ianh44\gst\aagam\Hermit00\-------------------

To understand the significance of the diversion created
by Professor Schmoller as regards the scope and method
of economics, it is necessary, very briefly, to indicate the
position occupied by that early generation of historical
economists from which his teaching diverged, and more
particularly those points of the older canon at which he
has come to differ characteristically from the views previously
in vogue.

As regards the situation in which the historical school,
as exemplified by its leaders, was then placed, it is, of
course, something of a commonplace that by the end of
its first twenty years of endeavor in the reform of economic
science the school had, in point of systematic results,
scarcely got beyond preliminaries. And even these
preliminaries were not in all respects obviously to the
purpose. A new and wider scope had been indicated
for economic inquiry, as well as a new aim and method for
theoretical discussion. But the new ideals of theoretical
advance, as well as the ways and means indicated for
their attainment, still had mainly a speculative interest.
Nothing substantial had been done towards the realisation
of the former or the <i>mise en [oe]uvre</i> of the latter. The
historical economists can scarcely be said at that time to
have put their hand to the new engines which they professed
to house in their workshop. Apart from polemics
and speculation concerning ideals, the serious interest and
endeavors of the school had up to that time been in the
field of history rather than in that of economics, except so
far as the adepts of the new school continued in a fragmentary
way to inculcate and, in some slight and uncertain
degree, to elaborate the dogmas of the classical writers
whom they sought to discredit.

The character of historical economics at the time when
Professor Schmoller entered on his work of criticism and
-----File: 266.png---\Pitirim\nebogipfel\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
revision is fairly shown by Roscher's writings. Whatever
may be thought to-day of Roscher's rank as an
economist, in contrast with Knies and Hildebrand, it will
scarcely be questioned that at the close of the first quarter-century
of the life history of the historical school it
was Roscher's conception of the scope and method of
economics that found the widest acceptance and that best
expressed the animus of that body of students who professed
to cultivate economics by the historical method.
For the purpose in hand Roscher's views may, therefore,
be taken as typical, all the more readily since for the very
general purpose here intended there are no serious discrepancies
between Roscher and his two illustrious contemporaries.
The chief difference is that Roscher is
more na√Øve and more specific. He has also left a more
considerable volume of results achieved by the professed
use of his method.

Roscher's professed method was what he calls the "historico-physiological"
method. This he contrasts with the
"philosophical" or "idealistic" method. But his air of
depreciation as regards "philosophical" methods in economics
must not be taken to mean that Roscher's own
economic speculations were devoid of all philosophical or
metaphysical basis. It only means that his philosophical
postulates were different from those of the economists
whom he discredits, and that they were regarded by him
as self-evident.

As must necessarily be the case with a writer who had
neither a special aptitude for nor special training in philosophical
inquiries, Roscher's metaphysical postulates are,
of course, chiefly tacit. They are the common-sense, commonplace
metaphysics afloat in educated German circles
in the time of Roscher's youth,--during the period when
his growth and education gave him his outlook on life
-----File: 267.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
and knowledge and laid the basis of his intellectual habits;
which means that these postulates belong to what
H√∂ffding has called the "Romantic" school of thought,
and are of a Hegelian complexion. Roscher being not a
professed philosophical student, it is neither easy nor safe
to particularise closely as regards his fundamental metaphysical
tenets; but, as near as so specific an identification
of his philosophical outlook is practicable, he must
be classed with the Hegelian "Right." But since the
Hegelian metaphysics had in Roscher's youth an unbroken
vogue in reputable German circles, especially in those
ultra-reputable circles within which lay the gentlemanly
life and human contact of Roscher, the postulates afforded
by the Hegelian metaphysics were accepted simply
as a matter of course, and were not recognised as
metaphysical at all. And in this his metaphysical affiliation
Roscher is fairly typical of the early historical school
of economics.

The Hegelian metaphysics, in so far as bears upon the
matter in hand, is a metaphysics of a self-realising life
process. This life process, which is the central and substantial
fact of the universe, is of a spiritual nature,--
"spiritual," of course, being here not contrasted with
"material." The life process is essentially active, self-determining,
and unfolds by inner necessity,--by necessity
of its own substantially active nature. The course
of culture, in this view, is an unfolding (exfoliation) of
the human spirit; and the task which economic science
has in hand is to determine the laws of this cultural exfoliation
in its economic aspect. But the laws of the cultural
development with which the social sciences, in the
Hegelian view, have to do are at one with the laws of the
processes of the universe at large; and, more immediately,
they are at one with the laws of the life process at
-----File: 268.png---\Pitirim\griff4\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
large. For the universe at large is itself a self-unfolding
life process, substantially of a spiritual character, of which
the economic life process which occupies the interest of
the economist is but a phase and an aspect. Now, the
course of the processes of unfolding life in organic nature
has been fairly well ascertained by the students of
natural history and the like; and this, in the nature of the
case, must afford a clew to the laws of cultural development,
in its economic as well as in any other of its aspects
or bearings,--the laws of life in the universe being all
substantially spiritual and substantially at one. So we
arrive at a physiological conception of culture after the
analogy of the ascertained physiological processes seen
in the biological domain. It is conceived to be physiological
after the Hegelian manner of conceiving a physiological
process, which is, however, not the same as the modern
scientific conception of a physiological process.[4]

[Footnote 4: A physiological conception of society, or of the community,
had been employed before,--<i>e.g.</i>, by the Physiocrats,--and such a
concept was reached also by English speculators--<i>e.g.</i>, Herbert
Spencer--during Roscher's lifetime; but these physiological conceptions
of society are reached by a different line of approach
from that which led up to the late-Hegelian physiological or biological
conception of human culture as a spiritual structure and
process. The outcome is also a different one, both as regards the
use made of the analogy and as regards the theoretical results
reached by its aid.

It may be remarked, by the way, that neo-Hegelianism, of the
"Left," likewise gave rise to a theory of a self-determining cultural
exfoliation; namely, the so-called "Materialistic Conception
of History" of the Marxian socialists. This Marxian conception,
too, had much of a physiological air; but Marx and his co-*adjutors
had an advantage over Roscher and his following, in
that they were to a greater extent schooled in the Hegelian
philosophy, instead of being uncritical receptacles of the Romantic
commonplaces left by Hegelianism as a residue in popular
thought. They were therefore more fully conscious of the bearing
of their postulates and less na√Øve in their assumptions of self-sufficiency.]
-----File: 269.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----

Since this quasi-physiological process of cultural development
is conceived to be an unfolding of the self-realising
human spirit, whose life history it is, it is of
the nature of the case that the cultural process should
run through a certain sequence of phases--a certain life
history prescribed by the nature of the active, unfolding
spiritual substance. The sequence is determined on the
whole, as regards the general features of the development,
by the nature of life on the human plane. The history
of cultural growth and decline necessarily repeats itself,
since it is substantially the same human spirit that seeks
to realise itself in every comprehensive sequence of cultural
development, and since this human spirit is the only
factor in the case that has substantial force. In its
generic features the history of past cultural cycles is,
therefore, the history of the future. Hence the importance,
not to say the sole efficacy for economic science, of
an historical scrutiny of culture. A well-authenticated
sequence of cultural phenomena in the history of the past
is conceived to have much the same binding force for the
sequence of cultural phenomena in the future as a "natural
law," as the term has been understood in physics or
physiology, is conceived to have as regards the course
of phenomena in the life history of the human body; for
the onward cultural course of the human spirit, actively
unfolding by inner necessity, is an organic process, following
logically from the nature of this self-realising
spirit. If the process is conceived to meet with obstacles
or varying conditions, it adapts itself to the circumstances
in any given case, and it then goes on along the line of
its own logical bent until it eventuates in the consummation
given by its own nature. The environment, in this
view, if it is not to be conceived simply as a function of
the spiritual force at work, is, at the most, of subsidiary
-----File: 270.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
and transient consequence only. Environmental conditions
can at best give rise to minor perturbations; they do
not initiate a cumulative sequence which can profoundly
affect the outcome or the ulterior course of the cultural
process. Hence the sole, or almost sole, importance of
historical inquiry in determining the laws of cultural development,
economic or other.

The working conception which this romantic-historical
school had of economic life, therefore, is, in its way, a
conception of development, or evolution; but it is not to
be confused with Darwinism or Spencerianism. Inquiry
into the cultural development under the guidance of such
preconceptions as these has led to generalisations, more
or less arbitrary, regarding uniformities of sequence in
phenomena, while the causes which determine the course
of events, and which make the uniformity or variation of
the sequence, have received but scant attention. The
"natural laws" found by this means are necessarily of the
nature of empiricism, colored by the bias or ideals of the
investigator. The outcome is a body of aphoristic wisdom,
perhaps beautiful and valuable after its kind, but
quite fatuous when measured by the standards and aims
of modern science. As is well known, no substantial
theoretical gain was made along this romantic-historical
line of inquiry and speculation, for the reason, apparently,
that there are no cultural laws of the kind aimed at, beyond
the unprecise generalities that are sufficiently familiar
beforehand to all passably intelligent adults.

<tb>

It has seemed necessary to offer this much in characterisation
of that "historical" aim and method which
afforded a point of departure for Professor Schmoller's
work of revision. When he first raised his protest against
the prevailing ideals and methods, as being ill-advised and
-----File: 271.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------
not thorough-going, he does not seem himself to have been
entirely free from this Romantic, or Hegelian, bias.
There is evidence to the contrary in his early writings.[5]
It cannot even be said that his later theoretical work does
not show something of the same animus, as, <i>e.g.</i>, when he
assumes that there is a meliorative trend in the course of
cultural events.[6] What has differentiated his work from
that of the group of writers which has above been called
the elder line of historical economics is the weakness or
relative absence of this bias in his theoretical work. Particularly,
he has refused to bring his researches in the field
of theory definitely to rest on ground given by the Hegelian,
or Romantic, school of thought. He was from the
first unwilling to accept classificatory statements of uniformity
or of normality as an adequate answer to questions
of scientific theory. He does not commonly deny
the truth or the importance of the empirical generalisations
aimed at by the early historical economists. Indeed,
he makes much of them and has been notoriously urgent
for a full survey of historical data and a painstaking digestion
of materials with a view to a comprehensive work
of empirical generalisation. As is well known, in his
earlier work of criticism and methodological controversy
he was led to contend that for at least one generation
economists must be content to spend their energies on
descriptive work of this kind; and he thereby earned the
reputation of aiming to reduce economics to a descriptive
knowledge of details and to confine its method to the
Baconian ground of generalisation by simple enumeration.
But this exhaustive historical scrutiny and description of

[Footnote 5: <i>E.g.</i>, in his controversy with Treitschke. See <i>Grundfragen
der Socialpolitik und der Volkswirtschaftslehre</i>, particularly pp.
24, 25.]

[Footnote 6: <i>E.g.</i>, <i>Grundriss</i>, pp. 225, 409, 411.]
-----File: 272.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
detail has always, in Professor Schmoller's view, been
preliminary to an eventual theory of economic life. The
survey of details and the empirical generalisations reached
by its help are useful for the scientific purpose only as
they serve the end of an eventual formulation of the laws
of causation that work out in the process of economic life.
The ulterior question, to which all else is subsidiary, is a
question of the causes at work rather than a question of
the historical uniformities observable in the sequence of
phenomena. The scrutiny of historical details serves this
end by defining the scope and character of the several
factors causally at work in the growth of culture, and,
what is of more immediate consequence, as they are at
work in the shaping of the economic activities and the
economic aims of men engaged in this unfolding cultural
process as it lies before the investigator in the existing
situation.

In the preliminary work, then, of defining and characterising
the causes or factors of economic life, historical
investigation plays a large, if not the largest, part; but it
is by no means the sole line of inquiry to which recourse
is had for this purpose. Nor, it may be added, is this the
sole use of historical inquiry. To the like end a comparative
study of the climatic, geographical, and geological
features of the community's environment is drawn into
the inquiry; and more particularly there is a careful study
of ethnographic parallels and a scrutiny of the psychological
foundations of culture and the psychological factors
involved in cultural change.

Hence it appears that Professor Schmoller's work differs
from that of the elder line of historical economics in
respect of the scope and character of the preliminaries of
economic theory no less than in the ulterior aim which he
assigns the science. It is only by giving a very broad
-----File: 273.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
meaning to the term that this latest development of the
science can be called an "historical" economics. It is
Darwinian rather than Hegelian, although with the earmarks
of Hegelian affiliation visible now and again; and
it is "historical" only in a sense similar to that in which
a Darwinian account of the evolution of economic institutions
might be called historical. For the distinguishing
characteristic of Professor Schmoller's work, that
wherein it differs from the earlier work of the economists
of his general class, is that it aims at a Darwinistic account
of the origin, growth, persistence, and variation of
institutions, in so far as these institutions have to do with
the economic aspect of life either as cause or as effect.
In much of what he has to say, he is at one with his contemporaries
and predecessors within the historical school;
and he shows at many points both the excellences and
weaknesses due to his "historical" antecedents. But his
striking and characteristic merits lie in the direction of a
post-Darwinian, causal theory of the origin and growth of
species in institutions. In this line of theoretical inquiry
Professor Schmoller is not alone, nor does he, perhaps,
go so far or with such singleness of purpose in this direction
as some others do at given points; but the seniority
belongs to him, and he is also in the lead as regards the
comprehensiveness of his work.

<tb>

But to return to the <i>Grundriss</i>, to which recourse must
be had to substantiate the characterisation here offered.
The entire work as projected comprises an Introduction
and four Books, of which the introduction and the first
two books are contained in the volume already published.
The two books yet to be published, in a second volume,
promise to be of a length corresponding to the first two.
The present volume should accordingly contain approxi-*
-----File: 274.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*mately three-fifths of the whole, counted by bulk. The
scheme of the work is as follows: An Introduction (pp.
1-124) treats of (1) the Concept of Economics, (2) the
Psychical, Ethical (or Conventional, <i>sittliche</i>), and Legal
Foundations of Economic Life and of Culture, and (3)
the Literature and Method of the Science. This is followed
by Book I. (pp. 125-228) on Land, Population,
and the Industrial Arts, considered as collective phenomena
and factors in economic life, and Book II. (pp.
229-457), on the Constitution of Economic Society, its
chief organs and the causal factors to which they are due.
Books III. and IV. are to deal with the Circulation of
Goods and the Distribution of Income, and to give a
genetic account of the Development of Economic Society.

The course outlined differs noticeably from what has
been customary in treatises on economics. The point of
departure is a comprehensive general survey of the factors
which enter into the growth of culture, with special
reference to their economic bearing. This survey runs
chiefly on psychological and ethnographic ground, historical
inquiry in the stricter sense being relatively scant
and obviously of secondary consequence. It is followed
up with a more detailed and searching discussion of the
factors engaged in the economic process in any given situation.
The factors, or "collective phenomena," in question
are not the time-honored Land, Labor, and Capital,
but rather population, material environment, and technological
conditions. Here, too, the discussion has to do
with ethnographic rather than with properly historical
material. The question of population concerns not the
numerical force of laborers, but rather the diversity of
race characteristics and the bearing of race endowment
upon the growth of economic institutions. The discussion
of the material environment, again, has relatively
-----File: 275.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
little to say of the fertility of the soil, and gives much
attention to diversities of climate, geographical situation,
and geological and biological conditions. And this first
book closes with a survey of the growth of technological
knowledge and the industrial arts.

In all this the significant innovation lies not so much
in the character of the details. They are for the most
part commonplace enough as details of the sciences from
which they are borrowed. They are shrewdly chosen and
handled in such a way as to bring out their bearing upon
the ulterior questions about which the economist's interest
centers; but there is, as might be expected, little attempt
to go back of the returns given by specialists in the several
lines of research that are laid under contribution. But
the significance of it all lies rather in the fact that material
of this kind should have been drawn upon for a
foundation for economic theory, and that it should have
seemed necessary to Professor Schmoller to make this
introductory survey so comprehensive and so painstaking
as it is. Its meaning is that these features of human
nature and these forces of nature and circumstances of
environment are the agencies out of whose interaction the
economic situation has arisen by a cumulative process of
change, and that it is this cumulative process of development,
and its complex and unstable outcome, that are to
be the economist's subject-matter. The theoretical outcome
for which such a foundation is prepared is necessarily
of a genetic kind. It necessarily seeks to know and
explain the structure and functions of economic society in
terms of how and why they have come to be what they
are, not, as so many economic writers have explained
them, in terms of what they are good for and what they
ought to be. It means, in other words, a deliberate attempt
to substitute an inquiry into the efficient causes of
-----File: 276.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
economic life in the place of empirical generalisations, on
the one hand, and speculations as to the eternal fitness of
things, on the other hand.

It follows from the nature of the case that an economics
of this genetic character, working on grounds of
the kind indicated, comprises nothing in the way of advice
or admonition, no maxims of expediency, and no
economic, political, or cultural creed. How nearly Professor
Schmoller conforms to this canon of continence is
another question. The above indicates the scope of such
doctrines as are consistently derivable from the premises
with which the work under review starts out, not the
scope of its writer's speculations on economic matters.

The second book, by the help of prehistoric and ethnographic
material as well as history, deals with the evolution
of the methods of social organisation,--the growth
of institutions in so far as this growth shapes or is shaped
by the exigencies of economic life. The "organs," or
social-economic institutions, whose life history is passed
in review are: the family; the methods of settlement and
domicile, in town and country; the political units of control
and administration; differentiation of functions between
industrial and other classes and groups; ownership,
its growth and distribution; social classes and associations;
business enterprise, industrial organisations and
corporations.

As regards the singleness of purpose with which Professor
Schmoller has carried out the scheme of economic
theory for which he has sketched the outlines and pointed
the way, it is not possible to speak with the same confidence
as of his preliminary work. It goes without saying
that this further work of elaboration is excellent after its
kind; and this excellence, which was to be looked for at
Professor Schmoller's hands, may easily divert the read-*
-----File: 277.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*er's attention from the shortcomings of the work in respect
of kind rather than of quality. Now, while a broad
generalisation on this head may be hazardous and is to be
taken with a large margin, still, with due allowance, the
following generalisation will probably stand, so far as
regards this first volume. So long as the author is occupied
with the life-history of institutions down to contemporary
developments, so long his discussion proceeds by
the dry light of the scientific interest, simply, as the term
"scientific" is understood among the modern adepts of
the natural sciences; but so soon as he comes to close
quarters with the situation of to-day, and reaches the
point where a dispassionate analysis and exposition of
the causal complex at work in contemporary institutional
changes should begin, so soon the scientific light breaks
up into all the colors of the rainbow, and the author
becomes an eager and eloquent counselor, and argues the
question of what ought to be and what modern society
must do to be saved. The argument at this point loses
the character of a genetic explanation of phenomena, and
takes on the character of appeal and admonition, urged
on grounds of expediency, of morality, of good taste, of
hygiene, of political ends, and even of religion. All this,
of course, is what we are used to in the common run of
writers of the historical school; but those students whose
interest centers in the science rather than in the ways and
means of maintaining the received cultural forms of German
society have long fancied they had ground to hope
for something more to the purpose when Professor
Schmoller came to put forth his great systematic work.
Brilliant and no doubt valuable in its way and for its end,
this digression into homiletics and reformatory advice
means that the argument is running into the sands just at
the stage where the science can least afford it. It is pre-*
-----File: 278.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*cisely at this point, where men of less years and breadth
and weight would find it difficult to hold tenaciously to the
course of cause and effect through the maze of jarring
interests and sentiments that make up the contemporary
situation,--it is precisely at this point that a genetic
theory of economic life most needs the guidance of the
firm, trained, dispassionate hand of the master. And at
this point his guidance all but fails us.

What has just been said applies generally to Professor
Schmoller's treatment of contemporary economic development,
and it should be added that it applies at nearly all
points with more or less of qualification. But the qualifications
required are not large enough to belie the general
characterisation just offered. It would be asking too
large an indulgence to follow the point up in this place
through all the discussions of the volume that fairly come
under this criticism. The most that may be done is to
point for illustration to the handling which two or three
of the social-economic "organs" receive. So, for instance,
Book II. opens with an account of the family and
its place and function in the structure of economic society.
The discussion proceeds along the beaten paths of ethnographic
research, with repeated and well-directed recourse
to the psychological knowledge that Professor Schmoller
always has well in hand. Coming down into recent times,
the discussion still proceeds to show how the large economic
changes of late medi√¶val and early modern times
acted to break down the patriarchal r√©gime of the earlier
culture; but at the same time there comes into sight (pp.
245-249) a bias in favor of the recent as against the earlier
form of the household. The author is no longer content
to show the exigencies which set the earlier patriarchal
household aside in favor of the modified patriarchal
household of more recent times. He also offers
-----File: 279.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
reasons why the later, modified form is intrinsically the
more desirable; reasons, it should perhaps be said, which
may be well taken, but which are beside the point so far
as regards a scientific explanation of the changes under
discussion.

The closing paragraphs of the section (91) dwell with
a kindly insistence on the many elements of strength and
beauty possessed by the form of household organisation
handed down from the past generation to the present.
The facts herewith recited by the author are, no doubt,
of weight, and must be duly taken account of by any
economist who ventures on a genetic discussion of the
present situation and the changing fortunes of the received
household. But Professor Schmoller has failed
even to point out in what manner these elements of
strength and beauty have in the recent past or may in the
present and immediate future causally affect the fortunes
of the institution. The failure to turn the material in
question to scientific account becomes almost culpable in
Professor Schmoller, since there are few, if any, who are
in so favorable a position to outline the argument which a
theoretical account of the situation at this point must take.
Plainly, as shown by Professor Schmoller's argument,
economic exigencies are working an incessant cumulative
change in the form of organisation of the modern household;
but he has done little towards pointing out in what
manner and with what effect these exigencies come into
play. Neither has he gone at all into the converse question,
equally grave as a question of economic theory, of
how the persistence, even though qualified, of the patriarchal
family has modified and is modifying economic
structure and function at other points and qualifying or
accentuating the very exigencies themselves to which the
changes wrought in the institution are to be traced.
-----File: 280.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\------
Plainly, too, the strength and beauty of the traditionally
received form of the household--that is to say, the
habits of life and of complacency which are bound up
with this household--are elements of importance in the
modern situation as affects the degree of persistence and
the direction of change which this institution shows under
modern circumstances. They are psychological facts,
facts of habit and propensity and spiritual fitness, the
efficiency of which as live forces making for survival or
variation is in this connection probably second to that of
no other factors that could be named. We had, therefore,
almost a right to expect that Professor Schmoller's
profound and comprehensive erudition in the fields of
psychology and cultural growth should turn these facts to
better ends than a preachment concerning an intrinsically
desirable consummation.

Regarding the present visible disintegration of the family,
and the closely related "woman question," Professor
Schmoller's observations are of much the same texture.
He notes the growing disinclination to the old-fashioned
family life on the part of the working population, and
shows that there are certain economic causes for this
growth or deterioration of sentiment. What he has to
offer is made up of the commonplaces of latter-day social-economic
discussion, and is charged with a strong undertone
of deprecation. What the trend of the causes at
work to alter or fortify this body of sentiment may be,
counts for very little in what he says on the present
movement or on the immediate future of the institution.
The best he has to offer on the "woman question" is an
off-hand reference of the ground of sentiment on which it
rests to a recrudescence of the eighteenth century spirit of
<i>√©galit√©</i>. This notion of the equality of the sexes he refutes
in graceful and affecting terms, and he pleads for
-----File: 281.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
the unbroken preservation of woman's sphere and man's
primacy; as if the matter of superiority or inferiority between
the sexes could conceivably be anything more than
a conventional outcome of the habits of life imposed
upon the community by the circumstances under which
they live. How it has come to pass that under the economic
exigencies of the past the physical and temperamental
diversity between the sexes has been conventionally
construed into a superiority of the man and an inferiority
of the woman,--on this head he has no more to
say or to suggest than on the correlate question of why
this conventional interpretation of the facts has latterly
not been holding its ancient ground. The discussion of
the family and of the relation of the sexes, in modern culture,
is marked throughout by unwillingness or inability
to penetrate behind the barrier of conventional finality.

The discussion of the family just cited occupies the
opening chapter of Book II. For a further instance of
Professor Schmoller's handling of a modern economic
problem, reference may be had to the closing chapter of
Book I., on the "Development of Technological Expedients
and its Economic Significance," but more particularly
the sections (84-86) on the modern machine industry
(pp. 211-228). In this discussion, also, the point of
interest is the attention given to the latter-day phenomena
of machine industry, and the author's method and animus
in dealing with them. There is (pp. 211-218) a condensed
and competent presentation of the main characteristics
of the modern "machine age," followed (pp.
218-228) by a critical discussion of its cultural value.
The customary eulogy, but with more than the customary
discrimination, is given to the advantages of the r√©gime
of the machine in point of economy, creature comforts,
and intellectual sweep; and it is pointed out how the r√©-*
-----File: 282.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*gime of the machine has brought about a redistribution of
wealth and of population and a reorganisation and redistribution
of social and economic structures and functions.
It is pointed out (p. 223) that the gravest social effect of
the machine industry has been the creation of a large class
of wage laborers. The material circumstances into which
this class has been thrown, particularly in point of physical
comfort, are dealt with in a sober and discriminating
way; and it is shown (p. 224) that in the days of its fuller
development the machine's r√©gime has evolved a class of
trained laborers who not only live in comfort, but are
sound and strong in mind and body. But with the citation
of these facts the pursuit of the chain of cause and
effect in this modern machine situation comes to an end.
The remainder of the space given to the subject is occupied
with extremely sane and well-advised criticism,
moral and √¶sthetic, and indications of what the proper
ideals and ends of endeavor should be.

Professor Schmoller misses the opportunity he here has
of dealing with this material in a scientific spirit and with
some valuable results for economic theory. He could, it
is not too bold to assume, have sketched for us an effective
method and line of research to be pursued, for instance,
in following up the scientific question of what may
be the cultural, spiritual effects of the machine's r√©gime
upon this large body of trained workmen, and what this
body of trained workmen in its turn counts for as a factor
in shaping the institutional growth of the present and the
economic and cultural situation of to-morrow. Work of
this kind, there is reason to believe, Professor Schmoller
could have done with better effect than any of his colleagues
in the science; for he is, as already noticed above,
possessed of the necessary qualifications in the way of
psychological training, broad knowledge of the play of
-----File: 283.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
cause and effect in cultural growth, and an ability to take
a scientific point of view. Instead of this he harks back
again to the dreary homiletical waste of the traditional
<i>Historismus</i>. It seems as if a topic which he deals with
as an objective matter so long as it lies outside the sphere
of every-day humanitarian and social solicitude, becomes
a matter to be passed upon by conventional standards of
taste, dignity, morality, and the like, so soon as it comes
within the sweep of latter-day German sentiment.

This habit of treating a given problem from these various
and shifting points of view at times gives a kaleidoscopic
effect that is not without interest. So in the matter
of the technically trained working population in the
machine industry, to which reference has already been
made, something of an odd confusion appears when expressions
taken from diverse phases of the discussion are
brought side by side. He speaks of this class at one point
(p. 224) as "sound, strong, spiritually and morally advancing,"
superior in all these virtues to the working
classes of other times and places. At another point (pp.
250-253) he speaks of the same popular element, under
the designation of "socialists," as perverse, degenerate,
and reactionary. This latter characterisation may be
substantially correct, but it proceeds on grounds of taste
and predilection, not on grounds of scientifically determinable
cause and effect. And the two characterisations
apply to the same elements of population; for the substantial
core and tone-giving factor of the radical socialistic
element in the German community is, notoriously,
just this technically trained population of the industrial
towns where the discipline of the machine industry has
been at work with least mitigation. The only other fairly
isolable element of a radical socialistic complexion is
found among the students of modern science. Now, fur-*
-----File: 284.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*ther, in his speculations on the relation of technological
knowledge to the advance of culture, Professor Schmoller
points out (<i>e.g.</i>, p. 226) that a high degree of culture
connotes, on the whole, a high degree of technological
efficiency, and conversely. In this connection he makes
use of the terms <i>Halbkulturv√∂lker</i> and <i>Ganskulturv√∂lker</i>
to designate different degrees of cultural maturity. It is
curious to reflect, in the light of what he has to say on
these several heads, that if the socialistically affected,
technically trained population of the industrial towns, together
with the radical-socialistic men of science, were abstracted
from the German population, leaving substantially
the peasantry, the slums, and the aristocracy great
and small, the resulting German community would unquestionably
have to be classed as a <i>Halbkulturv√∂lk</i> in
Professor Schmoller's scheme. Whereas the elements
abstracted, if taken by themselves, would as unquestionably
be classed among the <i>Ganskulturv√∂lker</i>.

In conclusion, one may turn to the concluding chapter
(Book II., Chapter vii.) of the present volume for a final
illustration of Professor Schmoller's method and animus
in handling a modern economic problem. All the more
so as this chapter on business enterprise better sustains
that scientific attitude which the introductory outline leads
the reader to look for throughout. It shows how modern
business enterprise is in the main an outgrowth of commercial
activity, as also that it has retained the commercial
spirit down to the present. The motive force of business
enterprise is the self-seeking quest of dividends; but Professor
Schmoller shows, with more dispassionate insight
than many economists, that this self-seeking motive is
hemmed in and guided at all points in the course of its
development by considerations and conventions that are
not of a primarily self-seeking kind. He is not content to
-----File: 285.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
point to the beneficent working of a harmony of interests,
but sketches the play of forces whereby a self-seeking
business traffic has come to serve the interests of the community.
Business enterprise has gradually emerged and
come into its present central and dominant position in the
community's industry as a concomitant of the growth of
individual ownership and pecuniary discretion in modern
life. It is therefore a phase of the modern cultural situation;
and its survival and the direction of its further
growth are therefore conditioned by the exigencies of the
modern cultural situation. What this modern cultural
situation is and what are the forces, essentially psychological,
which shape the further growth of the situation,
no one is better fitted to discuss than Professor Schmoller;
and he has also given valuable indications (pp. 428-457)
of what these factors are and how the inquiry into
their working must be conducted. But even here, where
a dispassionate tracing-out of the sequence of cause and
effect should be easier to undertake, because less readily
blurred with sentiment, than in the case, <i>e.g.</i>, of the family,
the work of tracing the developmental sequence tapers
off into advice and admonition proceeding on the assumption
that the stage now reached is, or at least should be,
final. The attention in the later pages diverges from the
process of growth and its conditioning circumstances, to
the desirability of maintaining the good results attained
and to the ways and means of holding fast that which is
good in the outcome already achieved. The question to
which an answer is sought in discussing the present phase
of the development is not a question as to what is taking
place as respects the institution of business enterprise, but
rather a question as to what form should be given to an
optimistic policy of fostering business enterprise and
turning it to account for the common good. At this
-----File: 286.png---\Pitirim\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----
point, as elsewhere, though perhaps in a less degree than
elsewhere, the existing form of the institution is accepted
as a finality. All this is disappointing in view of the fact
that at no other point do modern economic institutions
bear less of an air of finality than in the forms and conventions
of business organisations and relations. As
Professor Schmoller remarks (p. 455), the scope and
character of business undertakings necessarily conform to
the circumstances of the time, not to any logical scheme
of development from small to great or from simple to
complex. So also, one might be tempted to say, the expediency
and the chance of ultimate survival of business
enterprise is itself an open question, to be answered by a
scrutiny of the forces that make for its survival or alteration,
not by advice as to the best method of sustaining and
controlling it.

What has here been said in criticism of Professor
Schmoller's work, particularly as regards his departure
from the path of scientific research in dealing with
present-day phenomena, may, of course, have to be qualified,
if not entirely set aside, when his work is completed
with the promised genetic survey of modern institutions
to be set forth in the concluding fourth book. Perhaps
it may even be said that there is fair hope, on general
grounds, of such a consummation; but the present volume
does not afford ground for a confident expectation of this
kind. It is perhaps needless, perhaps gratuitous, to add
that the strictures offered indicate, after all, but relatively
slight shortcomings in a work of the first magnitude.

INDUSTRIAL AND PECUNIARY EMPLOYMENTS[1]


For purposes of economic theory, the various activities
of men and things about which economists busy
themselves were classified by the early writers according
to a scheme which has remained substantially unchanged,
if not unquestioned, since their time. This scheme is
the classical three-fold division of the factors of production
under Land, Labor, and Capital. The theoretical aim
of the economists in discussing these factors and the activities
for which they stand has not remained the same
throughout the course of economic discussion, and the
three-fold division has not always lent itself with facility
to new points of view and new purposes of theory,
but the writers who have shaped later theory have, on
the whole, not laid violent hands on the sacred formula.
These facts must inspire the utmost reserve and circumspection
in any one who is moved to propose even a
subsidiary distinction of another kind between economic
activities or agents. The terminology and the conceptual
furniture of economics are complex and parti-colored
enough without gratuitous innovation.

It is accordingly not the aim of this paper to set aside
the time-honored classification of factors, or even to formulate
an iconoclastic amendment, but rather to indicate
how and why this classification has proved inadequate
for certain purposes of theory which were not contemplated
by the men who elaborated it. To this end a

Economic Association</i>, series 3, Vol. II.]
-----File: 288.png---\skywrite\marcel dijkers\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\---
bit of preface may be in place as regards the aims which
led to its formulation and the uses which the three-fold
classification originally served.

<tb>

The economists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries were believers in a Providential order,
or an order of Nature. How they came by this belief
need not occupy us here; neither need we raise a question
as to whether their conviction of its truth was well
or ill grounded. The Providential order or order of Nature
is conceived to work in an effective and just way
toward the end to which it tends; and in the economic
field this objective end is the material welfare of mankind.
The science of that time set itself the task of
interpreting the facts with which it dealt, in terms of
this natural order. The material circumstances which
condition men's life fall within the scope of this natural
order of the universe, and as members of the universal
scheme of things men fall under the constraining guidance
of the laws of Nature, who does all things well.
As regards their purely theoretical work, the early economists
are occupied with bringing the facts of economic
life under natural laws conceived somewhat after the
manner indicated; and when the facts handled have been
fully interpreted in the light of this fundamental postulate
the theoretical work of the scientist is felt to have been
successfully done.

The economic laws aimed at and formulated under the
guidance of this preconception are laws of what takes
place "naturally" or "normally," and it is of the essence
of things so conceived that in the natural or normal
course there is no wasted or misdirected effort. The
standpoint is given by the material interest of mankind,
or, more concretely, of the community or "society" in
-----File: 289.png---\skywrite\kjyg\hbarrass\aagam\Hermit00\---------------
which the economist is placed; the resulting economic
theory is formulated as an analysis of the "natural"
course of the life of the community, the ultimate theoretical
postulate of which might, not unfairly, be stated
as in some sort a law of the conservation of economic
energy. When the course of things runs off naturally
or normally, in accord with the exigencies of human
welfare and the constraining laws of nature, economic
income and outgo balance one another. The natural
forces at play in the economic field may increase indefinitely
through accretions brought in under man's dominion
and through the natural increase of mankind, and,
indeed, it is of the nature of things that an orderly
progress of this kind should take place; but within the
economic organism, as within the larger organism of
the universe, there prevails an equivalence of expenditure
and returns, an equilibrium of flux and reflux,
which is not broken over in the normal course of things.
So it is, by implication, assumed that the product which
results from any given industrial process or operation is,
in some sense or in some unspecified respect, the equivalent
of the expenditure of forces, or of the effort, or what
not, that has gone into the process out of which the
product emerges.

This theorem of equivalence is the postulate which
lies at the root of the classical theory of distribution,
but it manifestly does not admit of proof--or of disproof
either, for that matter; since neither the economic forces
which go into the process nor the product which emerges
are, in the economic respect, of such a tangible character
as to admit of quantitative determination. They are
in fact incommensurable magnitudes. To this last remark
the answer may conceivably present itself that the
equivalence in question is an equivalence in utility or in
-----File: 290.png---\skywrite\Ymartin\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
exchange value, and that the quantitative determination
of the various items in terms of exchange value or of utility
is, theoretically, not impossible; but when it is called
to mind that the forces or factors which go to the production
of a given product take their utility or exchange
value from that of the product, it will easily be seen that
the expedient will not serve. The equivalence between
the aggregate factors of production in any given case
and their product remains a dogmatic postulate whose
validity cannot be demonstrated in any terms that will
not reduce the whole proposition to an aimless fatuity,
or to metaphysical grounds which have now been given
up.

The point of view from which the early, and even the
later classical, economists discussed economic life was
that of "the society" taken as a collective whole and
conceived as an organic unit. Economic theory sought
out and formulated the laws of the normal life of the
social organism, as it is conceived to work out in that
natural course whereby the material welfare of society
is attained. The details of economic life are construed,
for purposes of general theory, in terms of their subservience
to the aims imputed to the collective life
process. Those features of detail which will bear construction
as links in the process whereby the collective
welfare is furthered, are magnified and brought into the
foreground, while such features as will not bear this
construction are treated as minor disturbances. Such
a procedure is manifestly legitimate and expedient in a
theoretical inquiry whose aim is to determine the laws
of health of the social organism and the normal functions
of this organism in a state of health. The social organism
is, in this theory, handled as an individual endowed
with a consistent life purpose and something of an intelli-*
-----File: 291.png---\skywrite\amerisca\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*gent apprehension of what means will serve the ends
which it seeks. With these collective ends the interests
of the individual members are conceived to be fundamentally
at one; and, while men may not see that their
own individual interests coincide with those of the social
organism, yet, since men are members of the comprehensive
organism of nature and consequently subject to
beneficent natural law, the ulterior trend of unrestrained
individual action is, on the whole, in the right direction.

The details of individual economic conduct and its
consequences are of interest to such a general theory
chiefly as they further or disturb the beneficent "natural"
course. But if the aims and methods of individual
conduct were of minor importance in such an economic
theory, that is not the case as regards individual rights.
The early political economy was not simply a formulation
of the natural course of economic phenomena, but
it embodied an insistence on what is called "natural
liberty." Whether this insistence on natural liberty is to
be traced to utilitarianism or to a less specific faith in
natural rights, the outcome for the purpose in hand is
substantially the same. To avoid going too far afield,
it may serve the turn to say that the law of economic
equivalence, or conservation of economic energy, was,
in early economics, backed by this second corollary of
the order of nature, the closely related postulate of
natural rights. The classical doctrine of distribution
rests on both of these, and it is consequently not only a
doctrine of what must normally take place as regards
the course of life of society at large, but it also formulates
what ought of right to take place as regards the
remuneration for work and the distribution of wealth
among men.

Under the resulting natural-economic law of equiva-*
-----File: 292.png---\skywrite\Readingftw\hbarrass\A. B. Dahl\Hermit00\----
*lence and equity, it is held that the several participants
or factors in the economic process severally get the
equivalent of the productive force which they expend.
They severally get as much as they produce; and conversely,
in the normal case they severally produce as
much as they get. In the earlier formulations, as, for
example, in the authoritative formulation of Adam
Smith, there is no clear or consistent pronouncement as
regards the terms in which this equivalence between
production and remuneration runs. With the later,
classical economists, who had the benefit of a developed
utilitarian philosophy, it seems to be somewhat consistently
conceived in terms of an ill-defined serviceability.
With some later writers it is an equivalence of exchange
values; but as this latter reduces itself to tautology, it
need scarcely be taken seriously. When we are told in
the later political economy that the several agents or
factors in production normally earn what they get, it is
perhaps fairly to be construed as a claim that the economic
service rendered the community by any one of
the agents in production equals the service received by
the agent in return. In terms of serviceability, then, if
not in terms of productive force,[2] the individual agent,
or at least the class or group of agents to which the individual
belongs, normally gets as much as he contributes
and contributes as much as he gets. This applies
to all those employments or occupations which are ordinarily
carried on in any community, throughout the
aggregate of men's dealings with the material means of
life. All activity which touches industry comes in under
this law of equivalence and equity.

[Footnote 2: Some late writers, as, <i>e.g.</i>, J. B. Clark, apparently must be
held to conceive the equivalence in terms of productive force rather
than of serviceability; or, perhaps, in terms of serviceability on
one side of the equation and productive force on the other.]
-----File: 293.png---\skywrite\Readingftw\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-------

Now, to a theorist whose aim is to find the laws governing
the economic life of a social organism, and who
for this purpose conceives the economic community as
a unit, the features of economic life which are of particular
consequence are those which show the correlation
of efforts and the solidarity of interests. For this
purpose, such activities and such interests as do not fit
into the scheme of solidarity contemplated are of minor
importance, and are rather to be explained away or construed
into subservience to the scheme of solidarity
than to be incorporated at their face value into the theoretical
structure. Of this nature are what are here to
be spoken of under the term "pecuniary employments,"
and the fortune which these pecuniary employments
have met at the hands of classical economic theory is
such as is outlined in the last sentence.

In a theory proceeding on the premise of economic
solidarity, the important bearing of any activity that is
taken up and accounted for, is its bearing upon the
furtherance of the collective life process. Viewed from
the standpoint of the collective interest, the economic
process is rated primarily as a process for the provision
of the aggregate material means of life. As a late representative
of the classical school expresses it: "Production,
in fact, embraces every economic operation except
consumption."[3] It is this aggregate productivity, and the
bearing of all details upon the aggregate productivity,
that constantly occupies the attention of the classical
economists. What partially diverts their attention from
this central and ubiquitous interest, is their persistent lapse
into natural-rights morality.

The result is that acquisition is treated as a sub-head

[Footnote 3: J. B. Clark, <i>The Distribution of Wealth</i>, p. 20.]
-----File: 294.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
under production, and effort directed to acquisition is
construed in terms of production. The pecuniary activities
of men, efforts directed to acquisition and operations
incident to the acquisition or tenure of wealth, are
treated as incidental to the distribution to each of his particular
proportion in the production of goods. Pecuniary
activities, in short, are handled as incidental features of
the process of social production and consumption, as
details incident to the method whereby the social interests
are served, instead of being dealt with as the
controlling factor about which the modern economic process
turns.

Apart from the metaphysical tenets indicated above
as influencing them, there are, of course, reasons of economic
history for the procedure of the early economists
in so relegating the pecuniary activities to the background
of economic theory. In the days of Adam Smith,
for instance, economic life still bore much of the character
of what Professor Schmoller calls <i>Stadtwirtschaft</i>.
This was the case to some extent in practice, but still
more decidedly in tradition. To a greater extent than
has since been the case, households produced goods for
their own consumption, without the intervention of sale;
and handicraftsmen still produced for consumption
by their customers, without the intervention of a market.
In a considerable measure, the conditions which
the Austrian marginal-utility theory supposes, of a
producing seller and a consuming buyer, actually prevailed.
It may not be true that in Adam Smith's time
the business operations, the bargain and sale of goods,
were, in general, obviously subservient to their production
and consumption, but it comes nearer being true at
that time than at any time since then. And the tradition
having once been put into form and authenticated by
-----File: 295.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------
Adam Smith, that such was the place of pecuniary
transactions in economic theory, this tradition has lasted
on in the face of later and further changes. Under the
shadow of this tradition the pecuniary employments are
still dealt with as auxiliary to the process of production,
and the gains from such employments are still explained
as being due to a productive effect imputed to
them.

According to ancient prescription, then, all normal, legitimate
economic activities carried on in a well regulated
community serve a materially useful end, and so far
as they are lucrative they are so by virtue of and in proportion
to a productive effect imputed to them. But in
the situation as it exists at any time there are activities
and classes of persons which are indispensable to the
community, or which are at least unavoidably present in
modern economic life, and which draw some income from
the aggregate product, at the same time that these activities
are not patently productive of goods and can not
well be classed as industrial, in any but a highly sophisticated
sense. Some of these activities, which are concerned
with economic matters but are not patently of an
industrial character, are integral features of modern economic
life, and must therefore be classed as normal;
for the existing situation, apart from a few minor discrepancies,
is particularly normal in the apprehension of
present-day economists. Now, the law of economic
equivalence and equity says that those who normally receive
in income must perforce serve some productive
end; and, since the existing organization of society is
conceived to be eminently normal, it becomes imperative
to find some ground on which to impute industrial productivity
to those classes and employments which do not
at first view appear to be industrial at all. Hence there
-----File: 296.png---\KevinPhilippines\Yosemite_Don\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\--
is commonly visible in the classical political economy, ancient
and modern, a strong inclination to make the
schedule of industrially productive employments very
comprehensive; so that a good deal of ingenuity has been
spent in economically justifying their presence by specifying
the productive effect of such non-industrial factors
as the courts, the army, the police, the clergy, the schoolmaster,
the physician, the opera singer.

But these non-economic employments are not so much
to the point in the present inquiry; the point being
employments which are unmistakably economic, but not
industrial in the naive sense of the word industry, and
which yield an income.

Adam Smith analysed the process of industry in which
he found the community of his time engaged, and found
the three classes of agents or factors: Land, Labor, and
Capital (stock). The productive factors engaged being
thus determined, the norm of natural-economic equivalence
and equity already referred to above, indicated
what would be the natural sharers in the product. Later
economists have shown great reserve about departing
from this three-fold division of factors, with its correlated
three-fold division of sharers of remuneration; apparently
because they have retained an instinctive, indefeasible
trust in the law of economic equivalence which
underlies it. But circumstances have compelled the
tentative intrusion of a fourth class of agent and income.
The undertaker and his income presently came to
be so large and ubiquitous figures in economic life that
their presence could not be overlooked by the most
normalising economist. The undertaker's activity has
been interpolated in the scheme of productive factors, as
a peculiar and fundamentally distinctive kind of labor,
with the function of coordinating and directing industrial
-----File: 297.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
processes. Similarly, his income has been interpolated
in the scheme of distribution, as a peculiar kind of
wages, proportioned to the heightened productivity given
the industrial process by his work.[4] His work is discussed
in expositions of the theory of production. In
discussions of his functions and his income the point of
the argument is, how and in what degree does his activity
increase the output of goods, or how and in what degree
does it save wealth to the community. Beyond his
effect in enhancing the effective volume of the aggregate
wealth the undertaker receives but scant attention,
apparently for the reason that so soon as that point has
been disposed of the presence of the undertaker and his
income has been reconciled with the tacitly accepted
natural law of equivalence between productive service
and remuneration. The normal balance has been established,
and the undertaker's function has been justified
and subsumed under the ancient law that Nature does
all things well and equitably.

This holds true of the political economy of our grandfathers.
But this aim and method of handling the phenomena
of life for theoretical ends, of course, did not go
out of vogue abruptly in the days of our grandfathers.[5]
There is a large sufficiency of the like aim and animus
in the theoretical discussions of a later time; but specifically
to cite and analyse the evidence of its presence

[Footnote 4: The undertaker gets an income; therefore he must produce
goods. But human activity directed to the production of goods
is labor; therefore the undertaker is a particular kind of laborer.
There is, of course, some dissent from this position.]

[Footnote 5: The change which has supervened as regards the habitual resort
to a natural law of equivalence is in large part a change
with respect to the degree of immediacy and "reality" imputed
to this law, and to a still greater extent a change in the degree
of overtness with which it is avowed.]
-----File: 298.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
would be laborious, nor would it conduce to the general
peace of mind.

Some motion towards a further revision of the scheme
is to be seen in the attention which has latterly been
given to the function and the profits of that peculiar
class of undertakers whom we call speculators. But
even on this head the argument is apt to turn on the
question of how the services which the speculator is
conceived to render the community are to be construed
into an equivalent of his gains.[6] The difficulty of interpretation
encountered at this point is considerable,
partly because it is not quite plain whether the speculators
as a class come out of their transactions with a net
gain or with a net loss. A systematic net loss, or a no-profits
balance, would, on the theory of equivalence,
mean that the class which gets this loss or doubtful
gain is of no service to the community; yet we are, out of
the past, committed to the view that the speculator is
useful--indeed economically indispensable--and shall
therefore have his reward. In the discussions given to
the speculator and his function some thought is commonly
given to the question of the "legitimacy" of the
speculator's traffic. The legitimate speculator is held to
earn his gain by services of an economic kind rendered
the community. The recourse to this epithet, "legitimate,"
is chiefly of interest as showing that the tacit
postulate of a natural order is still in force. Legitimate
are such speculative dealings as are, by the theorist,
conceived to serve the ends of the community, while

[Footnote 6: See, <i>e.g.</i>, a paper by H. C. Emery in the <i>Papers and Proceedings
of the Twelfth Annual Meeting</i> of the American Economic
Association, on "The Place of the Speculator in the Theory of
Distribution," and more particularly the discussion following the
paper.]
-----File: 299.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------
illegitimate speculation is that which is conceived to be
disserviceable to the community.

The theoretical difficulty about the speculator and his
gains (or losses) is that the speculator <i>ex professo</i> is
quite without interest in or connection with any given
industrial enterprise or any industrial plant. He is, industrially
speaking, without visible means of support.
He may stake his risks on the gain or on the loss of the
community with equal chances of success, and he may
shift from one side to the other without winking.

The speculator may be treated as an extreme case of
undertaker, who deals exclusively with the business
side of economic life rather than with the industrial
side. But he differs in this respect from the common
run of business men in degree rather than in kind. His
traffic is a pecuniary traffic, and it touches industry only
remotely and uncertainly; while the business man as
commonly conceived is more or less immediately interested
in the successful operation of some concrete industrial
plant. But since the undertaker first broke into
economic theory, some change has also taken place as regards
the immediacy of the relations of the common run
of undertakers to the mechanical facts of the industries
in which they are interested. Half a century ago it
was still possible to construe the average business manager
in industry as an agent occupied with the superintendence
of the mechanical processes involved in the
production of goods or services. But in the later development
the connection between the business manager
and the mechanical processes has, on an average, grown
more remote; so much so, that his superintendence of the
plant or of the processes is frequently visible only to the
scientific imagination. That activity by virtue of which
the undertaker is classed as such makes him a business-*
-----File: 300.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\hbarrass\Cosmas\Hermit00\--------
*man, not a mechanic or foreman of the shop. His superintendence
is a superintendence of the pecuniary affairs
of the concern, rather than of the industrial plant; especially
is this true in the higher development of the modern
captain of industry. As regards the nature of the
employment which characterises the undertaker, it is
possible to distinguish him from the men who are mechanically
engaged in the production of goods, and to
say that his employment is of a business or pecuniary
kind, while theirs is of an industrial or mechanical kind.
It is not possible to draw a similar distinction between the
undertaker who is in charge of a given industrial concern,
and the business man who is in business but is not
interested in the production of goods or services. As
regards the character of employment, then, the line falls
not between legitimate and illegitimate pecuniary transactions,
but between business and industry.

The distinction between business and industry has, of
course, been possible from the beginning of economic
theory, and, indeed, the distinction has from time to
time temporarily been made in the contrast frequently
pointed out between the proximate interest of the business
man and the ulterior interest of society at large.
What appears to have hindered the reception of the distinction
into economic doctrine, is the constraining presence
of a belief in an order of Nature and the habit of
conceiving the economic community as an organism. The
point of view given by these postulates has made such a
distinction between employments not only useless, but
even disserviceable for the ends to which theory has been
directed. But the fact has come to be gradually more
and more patent that there are constantly, normally present
in modern economic life an important range of activities
and classes of persons who work for an income but
-----File: 301.png---\KitFry\armei\hbarrass\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
of whom it cannot be said that they, either proximately
or remotely, apply themselves to the production of goods.
Their services, proximate or remote, to society are often
of quite a problematical character. They are ubiquitous,
and it will scarcely do to say that they are anomalous, for
they are of ancient prescription, they are within the law
and within the pale of popular morals.

Of these strictly economic activities that are lucrative
without necessarily being serviceable to the community,
the greater part are to be classed as "business." Perhaps
the largest and most obvious illustration of these
legitimate business employments is afforded by the speculators
in securities. By way of further illustration may
be mentioned the extensive and varied business of real-estate
men (land-agents) engaged in the purchase and
sale of property for speculative gain or for a commission;
so, also, the closely related business of promoters
and boomers of other than real-estate ventures; as
also attorneys, brokers, bankers, and the like, although
the work performed by these latter will more obviously
bear interpretation in terms of social serviceability. The
traffic of these business men shades off insensibly from
that of the <i>bona fide</i> speculator who has no ulterior end
of industrial efficiency to serve, to that of the captain of
industry or entrepreneur as conventionally set forth in
the economic manuals.

The characteristic in which these business employments
resemble one another, and in which they differ
from the mechanical occupations as well as from other
non-economic employments, is that they are concerned
primarily with the phenomena of value--with exchange
or market values and with purchase and sale--and only
indirectly and secondarily, if at all, with mechanical
processes. What holds the interest and guides and shifts
-----File: 302.png---\KitFry\diogenespc\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\---------------
the attention of men within these employments is the
main chance. These activities begin and end within
what may broadly be called "the higgling of the market."
Of the industrial employments, in the stricter sense, it
may be said, on the other hand, that they begin and
end outside the higgling of the market. Their proximate
aim and effect is the shaping and guiding of material
things and processes. Broadly, they may be said to be
primarily occupied with the phenomena of material
serviceability, rather than with those of exchange value.
They are taken up with phenomena which make the
subject matter of Physics and the other material
sciences.

The business man enters the economic life process
from the pecuniary side, and so far as he works an effect
in industry he works it through the pecuniary dispositions
which he makes. He takes thought most immediately
of men's convictions regarding market values; and
his efforts as a business man are directed to the apprehension,
and commonly also to the influencing of men's
beliefs regarding market values. The objective point of
business is the diversion of purchase and sale into some
particular channel, commonly involving a diversion from
other channels. The laborer and the man engaged in
directing industrial processes, on the other hand, enter
the economic process from the material side; in their
characteristic work they take thought most immediately
of mechanical effects, and their attention is directed to
turning men and things to account for the compassing of
some material end. The ulterior aim, and the ulterior
effect, of these industrial employments may be some pecuniary
result; work of this class commonly results in
an enhancement, or at least an alteration, of market
values. Conversely, business activity may, and in a ma-*
-----File: 303.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
*jority of cases it perhaps does, effect an enhancement of
the aggregate material wealth of the community, or the
aggregate serviceability of the means at hand; but such
an industrial outcome is by no means bound to follow
from the nature of the business man's work.

From what has just been said it appears that, if we retain
the classical division of economic theory into Production,
Distribution, and Consumption, the pecuniary
employments do not properly fall under the first of these
divisions, Production, if that term is to retain the
meaning commonly assigned to it. In an earlier and
less specialised organisation of economic life, particularly,
the undertaker frequently performs the work of a
foreman or a technological expert, as well as the work
of business management. Hence in most discussions of
his work and his theoretical relations his occupation is
treated as a composite one. The technological side of
his composite occupation has even given a name to his
gains (wages of superintendence), as if the undertaker
were primarily a master-workman. The distinction at
this point has been drawn between classes of persons instead
of between classes of employments; with the result
that the evident necessity of discussing his technological
employment under production has given countenance
to the endeavor to dispose of the undertaker's business
activity under the same head. This endeavor has,
of course, not wholly succeeded.

In the later development, the specialisation of work
in the economic field has at this point progressed so far,
and the undertaker now in many cases comes so near
being occupied with business affairs alone, to the exclusion
of technological direction and supervision, that,
with this object lesson before us, we no longer have the
same difficulty in drawing a distinction between busi-*
-----File: 304.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------
*ness and industrial employments. And even in the earlier
days of the doctrines, when the aim was to dispose of
the undertaker's work under the theoretical head of Production,
the business side of his work persistently obtruded
itself for discussion in the books and chapters
given to Distribution and Exchange. The course taken
by the later theoretical discussion of the entrepreneur,
leaves no question but that the characteristic fact about
his work is that he is a business man, occupied with pecuniary
affairs.

Such pecuniary employments, of which the purely
fiscal or financiering forms of business are typical, are
nearly all and nearly throughout, conditioned by the institution
of property or ownership--an institution which,
as John Stuart Mill remarks, belongs entirely within
the theoretical realm of Distribution. Ownership, no
doubt, has its effect upon productive industry, and, indeed,
its effect upon industry is very large, both in scope
and range, even if we should not be prepared to go the
length of saying that it fundamentally conditions all industry;
but ownership is not itself primarily or immediately
a contrivance for production. Ownership directly
touches the results of industry, and only indirectly the
methods and processes of industry. If the institution of
property be compared with such another feature of our
culture, for instance, as the domestication of plants
or the smelting of iron, the meaning of what has just
been said may seem clearer.

So much then of the business man's activity as is conditioned
by the institution of property, is not to be
classed, in economic theory, as productive or industrial
activity at all. Its objective point is an alteration of the
distribution of wealth. His business is, essentially, to
sell and buy--sell in order to buy cheaper, buy in order
-----File: 305.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
to sell dearer.[7] It may or may not, indirectly, and in a
sense incidentally, result in enhanced production. The
business man may be equally successful in his enterprise,
and he may be equally well remunerated, whether
his activity does or does not enrich the community.
Immediately and directly, so long as it is confined to the
pecuniary or business sphere, his activity is incapable of
enriching or impoverishing the community as a whole
except, after the fashion conceived by the mercantilists,
through his dealings with men of other communities.
The circulation and distribution of goods incidental to the
business man's traffic is commonly, though not always or
in the nature of the case, serviceable to the community;
but the distribution of goods is a mechanical, not a pecuniary
transaction, and it is not the objective point of
business nor its invariable outcome. From the point of
view of business, the distribution or circulation of goods
is a means of gain, not an end sought.

It is true, industry is closely conditioned by business.
In a modern community, the business man finally decides
what may be done in industry, or at least in the
greater number and the more conspicuous branches of
industry. This is particularly true of those branches that
are currently thought of as peculiarly modern. Under
existing circumstances of ownership, the discretion in
economic matters, industrial or otherwise, ultimately rests
in the hands of the business men. It is their business to
have to do with property, and property means the discretionary
control of wealth. In point of character, scope
and growth, industrial processes and plants adapt themselves
to the exigencies of the market, wherever there is
a developed market, and the exigencies of the market
are pecuniary exigencies. The business man, through his

[Footnote 7: <i>Cf. e.g.</i>, Marx, <i>Capital</i>, especially bk. <sc>I</sc>[**or 1 ?], ch. <sc>IV</sc>.]
-----File: 306.png---\Chmwilliams\Yosemite_Don\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\--------
pecuniary dispositions, enforces his choice of what industrial
processes shall be in use. He can, of course,
not create or initiate methods or aims for industry; if
he does so he steps out of the business sphere into the
material domain of industry. But he can decide whether
and which of the known processes and industrial arts shall
be practiced, and to what extent. Industry must be conducted
to suit the business man in his quest for gain;
which is not the same as saying that it must be conducted
to suit the needs or the convenience of the community at
large. Ever since the institution of property was definitely
installed, and in proportion as purchase and sale
has been practiced, some approach has been made to a
comprehensive system of control of industry by pecuniary
transactions and for pecuniary ends, and the industrial
organisation is nearer such a consummation now
than it ever has been. For the great body of modern industry
the final term of the sequence is not the production
of the goods but their sale; the endeavor is not so
much to fit the goods for use as for sale. It is well known
that there are many lines of industry in which the cost of
marketing the goods equals the cost of making and transporting
them.

Any industrial venture which falls short in meeting
the pecuniary exigencies of the market declines and
yields ground to others that meet them with better effect.
Hence shrewd business management is a requisite to success
in any industry that is carried on within the scope of
the market. Pecuniary failure carries with it industrial
failure, whatever may be the cause to which the pecuniary
failure is due--whether it be inferiority of the goods
produced, lack of salesmanlike[** 2 words?] tact, popular prejudice,
scanty or ill-devised advertising, excessive truthfulness,
or what not. In this way industrial results are closely
-----File: 307.png---\KitFry\Yosemite_Don\maggiemeh\aagam\Hermit00\--------
dependent upon the presence of business ability; but the
cause of this dependence of industry upon business in a
given case is to be sought in the fact that other rival ventures
have the backing of shrewd business management,
rather than in any help which business management in the
aggregate affords to the aggregate industry of the community.
Shrewd and farsighted business management is
a requisite of survival in the competitive pecuniary struggle
in which the several industrial concerns are engaged,
because shrewd and farsighted business management
abounds and is employed by all the competitors. The
ground of survival in the selective process is fitness for
pecuniary gain, not fitness for serviceability at large. Pecuniary
management is of an emulative character and
gives, primarily, relative success only. If the change
were equitably distributed, an increase or decrease of the
aggregate or average business ability in the community
need not immediately affect the industrial efficiency or
the material welfare of the community. The like can not
be said with respect to the aggregate or average industrial
capacity of the men at work. The latter are,
on the whole, occupied with production of goods; the
business men, on the other hand, are occupied with the
acquisition of them.

Theoreticians who are given to looking beneath the
facts and to contemplating the profounder philosophical
meaning of life speak of the function of the undertaker
as being the guidance and coordination of industrial
processes with a view to economies of production. No
doubt, the remoter effect of business transactions often
is such co√∂rdination and economy, and, no doubt also,
the undertaker has such economy in view and is stimulated
to his maneuvers of combination by the knowledge
that certain economies of this kind are feasible and
-----File: 308.png---\Chmwilliams\LottieBooks\shadow_reader\Cosmas\Hermit00\-
will inure to his gain if the proper business arrangements
can be effected. But it is practicable to class even this
indirect furthering of industry by the undertaker as a
permissive guidance only. The men in industry must
first create the mechanical possibility of such new and
more economical methods and arrangements, before the
undertaker sees the chance, makes the necessary business
arrangements, and gives directions that the more effective
working arrangements be adopted.

It is notorious, and it is a matter upon which men
dilate, that the wide and comprehensive consolidations
and co√∂rdinations of industry, which often add so greatly
to its effectiveness, take place at the initiative of the
business men who are in control. It should be added
that the fact of their being in control precludes such
co√∂rdination from being effected except by their advice
and consent. And it should also be added, in order to
a passably complete account of the undertaker's function,
that he not only can and does effect economising co√∂rdinations[**co-ordination or coordination?; co√∂rdinations elsewhere -P2]
of a large scope, but he also can and does at
times inhibit the process of consolidation and co√∂rdination.
It happens so frequently that it might fairly be
said to be the common run that business interests and
undertaker's maneuvers delay consolidation, combination,
co√∂rdination, for some appreciable time after they
have become patently advisable on industrial grounds.
The industrial advisability or practicability is not the decisive
point. Industrial advisability must wait on the
eventual convergence of jarring pecuniary interests and
on the strategical moves of business men playing for
position.

Which of these two offices of the business man in
modern industry, the furthering or the inhibitory, has
the more serious or more far-reaching consequences is,
-----File: 309.png---\Chmwilliams\BabsP\shadow_reader\JackieB\Hermit00\----
on the whole, somewhat problematical. The furtherance
of co√∂rdination by the modern captain of industry bulks
large in our vision, in great part because the process of
widening co√∂rdination is of a cumulative character.
After a given step in co√∂rdination and combination has
been taken, the next step takes place on the basis of the
resulting situation. Industry, that is to say the working
force engaged in industry, has a chance to develop new
and larger possibilities to be taken further advantage of.
In this way each successive move in the enhancement of
the efficiency of industrial processes, or in the widening of
co√∂rdination in industrial processes, pushes the captain
of industry to a further concession, making possible a still
farther industrial growth. But as regards the undertaker's
inhibitory dealings with industrial co√∂rdination
the visible outcome is not so striking. The visible outcome
is simply that nothing of the kind then takes place
in the premises. The potential cumulative sequence is
cut off at the start, and so it does not figure in our appraisement
of the disadvantage incurred. The loss does
not commonly take the more obtrusive form of an absolute
retreat, but only that of a failure to advance
where the industrial situation admits of an advance.

It is, of course, impracticable to foot up and compare
gain and loss in such a case, where the losses, being of
the nature of inhibited growth, cannot be ascertained.
But since the industrial serviceability of the captain of
industry is, on the whole, of a problematical complexion,
it should be advisable for a cautious economic theory
not to rest its discussion of him on his serviceability.[8]

[Footnote 8: It is not hereby intended to depreciate the services rendered
the community by the captain of industry in his management of
business. Such services are no doubt rendered and are also no]*
-----File: 310.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------------

It appears, then, as all economists are no doubt aware,
that there is in modern society a considerable range of

*[Footnote: doubt of substantial value. Still less is it the intention to decry
the pecuniary incentive as a motive to thrift and diligence. It
may well be that the pecuniary traffic which we call business is
the most effective method of conducting the industrial policy of
the community; not only the most effective that has been contrived,
but perhaps the best that can be contrived. But that is a
matter of surmise and opinion. In a matter of opinion on a
point that can not be verified, a reasonable course is to say that
the majority are presumably in the right. But all that is beside
the point. However probable or reasonable such a view may be,
it can find no lodgment in modern scientific theory, except as a
corollary of secondary importance. Nor can scientific theory build
upon the ground it may be conceived to afford. Policy may so
build, but science can not. Scientific theory is a formulation of
the laws of phenomena in terms of the efficient forces at work in
the sequence of phenomena. So long as (under the old dispensation
of the order of nature) the animistically conceived natural
laws, with their God-given objective end, were considered to exercise
a constraining guidance over the course of events whereof
they were claimed to be laws, so long it was legitimate scientific
procedure for economists to formulate their theory in terms of
these laws of the natural course; because so long they were
speaking in terms of what was, to them, the efficient forces at
work. But so soon as these natural laws were reduced to the
plane of colorless empirical generalization as to what commonly
happens, while the efficient forces at work are conceived to be of
quite another cast, so soon must theory abandon the ground of
the natural course, sterile for modern scientific purposes, and
shift to the ground of the causal sequence, where alone it will
have to do with the forces at work as they are conceived in our
time. The generalisations regarding the normal course, as "normal"
has been defined in economics since J. S. Mill, are not of
the nature of theory, but only rule-of-thumb. And the talk
about the "function" of this and that factor of production, etc.,
in terms of the collective life purpose, goes to the same limbo;
since the collective life purpose is no longer avowedly conceived
to cut any figure in the every-day guidance of economic activities
or the shaping of economic results.

The doctrine of the social-economic function of the undertaker
may for the present purpose be illustrated by a supposititious parallel
from Physics. It is an easy generalisation, which will
scarcely be questioned, that, in practice, pendulums commonly]*
-----File: 311.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
activities, which are not only normally present, but which
constitute the vital core of our economic system; which
are not directly concerned with production, but
which are nevertheless lucrative. Indeed, the group
comprises most of the highly remunerative employments
in modern economic life. The gains from these employments
must plainly be accounted for on other grounds
than their productivity, since they need have no productivity.

But it is not only as regards the pecuniary employments
that productivity and remuneration are constitutionally
out of touch. It seems plain, from what has
already been said, that the like is true for the remuneration
gained in the industrial employments. Most wages,
particularly those paid in the industrial employments
proper, as contrasted with those paid for domestic or
personal service, are paid on account of pecuniary serviceability
to the employer, not on grounds of material
serviceability to mankind at large. The product is
valued, sought and paid for on account of and in some
proportion to its vendibility, not for more recondite rea-*

of the clock-case in which they are placed. The normality of this
parallelism is fortified by the further observation that the vibrations
are also commonly in a plane parallel with the nearest wall
of the room; and when it is further called to mind that the balance
which serves the purpose of a pendulum in watches similarly
vibrates in a plane parallel with the walls of its case, the
absolute normality of the whole arrangement is placed beyond
question. It is true, the parallelism is not claimed to be related
to the working of the pendulum, except as a matter of fortuitous
convenience; but it should be manifest from the generality of
the occurrence that in the normal case, in the absence of disturbing
causes, and in the long run, all pendulums will "naturally"
tend to swing in a plane faultlessly parallel with the nearest wall.
The use which has been made of the "organic concept," in
economics and in social science at large, is fairly comparable with
this supposititious argument concerning the pendulum.]
-----File: 312.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
*sons of ulterior human welfare at large. It results that
there is no warrant, in general theory, for claiming that
the work of highly paid persons (more particularly that
of highly paid business men) is of greater substantial
use to the community than that of the less highly paid.
At the same time, the reverse could, of course, also not
be claimed. Wages, resting on a pecuniary basis, afford
no consistent indication of the relative productivity of
the recipients, except in comparisons between persons
or classes whose products are identical except in amount,
--that is to say, where a resort to wages as an index of
productivity would be of no use anyway.[9]

<tb>

A result of the acceptance of the theoretical distinction
here attempted between industrial and pecuniary
employments and an effective recognition of the pecuniary
basis of the modern economic organisation would
be to dissociate the two ideas of productivity and remuneration.
In mathematical language, remuneration
could no longer be conceived and handled as a "function"
of productivity,--unless productivity be taken to
mean pecuniary serviceability to the person who pays
the remuneration. In modern life remuneration is, in
the last analysis, uniformly obtained by virtue of an
agreement between individuals who commonly proceed
on their own interest in point of pecuniary gain. The
remuneration may, therefore, be said to be a "function"
of the pecuniary service rendered the person who grants

[Footnote 9: Since the ground of payment of wages is the vendibility of the
product, and since the ground of a difference in wages is the different
vendibility of the product acquired through the purchase
of the labor for which the wages are paid, it follows that wherever
the difference in vendibility rests on a difference in the magnitude
of the product alone, there wages should be somewhat in
proportion to the magnitude of the product.]
-----File: 313.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------------
the remuneration; but what is pecuniarily serviceable to
the individual who exercises the discretion in the matter
need not be productive of material gain to the community
as a whole. Nor does the algebraic sum of individual
pecuniary gains measure the aggregate serviceability of
the activities for which the gains are got.

In a community organized, as modern communities
are, on a pecuniary basis, the discretion in economic
matters rests with the individuals, in severalty; and the
aggregate of discrete individual interests nowise expresses
the collective interest. Expressions constantly
recur in economic discussions which imply that the transactions
discussed are carried out for the sake of the collective
good or at the initiative of the social organism,
or that "society" rewards so and so for their
services. Such expressions are commonly of the nature
of figures of speech and are serviceable for homiletical
rather than for scientific use. They serve to express
their user's faith in a beneficent order of nature, rather
than to convey or to formulate information in regard to
facts.

Of course, it is still possible consistently to hold that
there is a natural equivalence between work and its reward,
that remuneration is naturally, or normally, or in
the long run, proportioned to the material service rendered
the community by the recipient; but that proposition
will hold true only if "natural" or "normal" be
taken in such a sense as to admit of our saying that the
natural does not coincide with the actual; and it must be
recognised that such a doctrine of the "natural" apportionment
of wealth or of income disregards the efficient
facts of the case. Apart from effects of this kind in
the way of equitable arrangements traceable to grounds
of sentiment, the only recourse which modern science
-----File: 314.png---\Pitirim\a041awe\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\----------------
would afford the champion of a doctrine of natural distribution,
in the sense indicated, would be a doctrine of
natural selection; according to which all disserviceable
or unproductive, wasteful employments would, perforce,
be weeded out as being incompatible with the continued
life of any community that tolerated them. But such a
selective elimination of unserviceable or wasteful employments
would presume the following two conditions,
neither of which need prevail: (1) It must be assumed
that the disposable margin between the aggregate productivity
of industry and the aggregate necessary consumption
is so narrow as to admit of no appreciable
waste of energy or of goods; (2) it must be assumed that
no deterioration of the condition of society in the economic
respect does or can "naturally" take place. As
to the former of these two assumptions, it is to be said
that in a very poor community, and under exceptionally
hard economic circumstances, the margin of production
may be as narrow as the theory would require. Something
approaching this state of things may be found,
for instance, among some Eskimo tribes. But in a
modern industrial community--where the margin of admissible
waste probably always exceeds fifty per cent, of
the output of goods--the facts make no approach to the
hypothesis. The second assumed condition is, of course,
the old-fashioned assumption of a beneficent, providential
order or meliorative trend in human affairs. As such,
it needs no argument at this day. Instances are not far
to seek of communities in which economic deterioration
has taken place while the system of distribution, both
of income and of accumulated wealth, has remained on
a pecuniary basis.

<tb>

To return to the main drift of the argument. The
-----File: 315.png---\Pitirim\a041awe\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\----------------
pecuniary employments have to do with wealth in point
of ownership, with market values, with transactions of
exchange, purchase and sale, bargaining for the purpose
of pecuniary gain. These employments make up the
characteristic occupations of business men, and the gains
of business are derived from successful endeavors of the
pecuniary kind. These business employments are the
characteristic activity (constitute the "function") of
what are in theory called undertakers. The dispositions
which undertakers, <i>qua</i> business men, make are pecuniary
dispositions--whatever industrial sequel they may
or may not have--and are carried out with a view to
pecuniary gain. The wealth of which they have the
discretionary disposal may or may not be in the form of
"production goods"; but in whatever form the wealth
in question is conceived to exist, it is handled by the
undertakers in terms of values and is disposed of by
them in the pecuniary respect. When, as may happen,
the undertaker steps down from the pecuniary plane and
directs the mechanical handling and functioning of
"production goods," he becomes for the time a foreman.
The undertaker, if his business venture is of the industrial
kind, of course takes cognizance of the aptness of a
given industrial method or process for his purpose, and
he has to choose between different industrial processes
in which to invest his values; but his work as undertaker,
simply, is the investment and shifting of the values
under his hand from the less to the more gainful point
of investment. When the investment takes the form
of material means of industry, or industrial plant, the
sequel of a given business transaction is commonly
some particular use of such means; and when such industrial
use follows, it commonly takes place at the
hands of other men than the undertaker, although it
-----File: 316.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
takes place within limits imposed by the pecuniary exigencies
of which the undertaker takes cognizance.
Wealth turned to account in the way of investment or
business management may or may not, in consequence,
be turned to account, materially, for industrial effect.
Wealth, values, so employed for pecuniary ends is capital
in the business sense of the word.[10] Wealth, material
means of industry, physically employed for industrial
ends is capital in the industrial sense. Theory,
therefore, would require that care be taken to distinguish
between capital as a pecuniary category, and capital as
an industrial category, if the term capital is retained
to cover the two concepts.[11] The distinction here made
substantially coincides with a distinction which many
late writers have arrived at from a different point of
approach and have, with varying success, made use of
under different terms.[12]

A further corollary touching capital may be pointed
out. The gains derived from the handling of capital in
the pecuniary respect have no immediate relation, stand
in no necessary relation of proportion, to the productive
effect compassed by the industrial use of the material

[Footnote 10: All wealth so used is capital, but it does not follow that all
pecuniary capital is social wealth.]

[Footnote 11: In current theory the term capital is used in these two
senses; while in business usage it is employed pretty consistently
in the former sense alone. The current ambiguity in the term
capital has often been adverted to by economists, and there may
be need of a revision of the terminology at this point; but this
paper is not concerned with that question.]

[Footnote 12: Professor Fetter, in a recent paper (<i>Quarterly Journal of
Economics</i>, November, 1900) is, perhaps, the writer who has gone
the farthest in this direction in the definition of the capital concept.
Professor Fetter wishes to confine the term capital to
pecuniary capital, or rather to such pecuniary capital as is based
on the ownership of material goods. The wisdom of such a
terminological expedient is, of course, not in question here.]
-----File: 317.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------------
means over which the undertaker may dispose; although
the gains have a relation of dependence to the effects
achieved in point of vendibility. But vendibility need
not, even approximately, coincide with serviceability,
except serviceability be construed in terms of marginal
utility or some related conception, in which case the
outcome is a tautology. Where, as in the case commonly
assumed by economists as typical, the investing undertaker
seeks his gain through the production and sale of
some useful article, it is commonly also assumed that
his effort is directed to the most economical production
of as large and serviceable a product as may be, or at
least it is assumed that such production is the outcome
of his endeavors in the natural course of things. This
account of the aim and outcome of business enterprise
may be natural, but it does not describe the facts. The
facts being, of course, that the undertaker in such a
case seeks to produce economically as vendible a product
as may be. In the common run vendibility depends
in great part on the serviceability of the goods,
but it depends also on several other circumstances; and
to that highly variable, but nearly always considerable
extent to which vendibility depends on other circumstances
than the material serviceability of the goods,
the pecuniary management of capital must be held not
to serve the ends of production. Neither immediately,
in his purely pecuniary traffic, nor indirectly, in the
business guidance of industry through his pecuniary
traffic, therefore, can the undertaker's dealings with his
pecuniary capital be accounted a productive occupation,
nor can the gains of capital be taken to mark or to measuse[** typo for "measure"?]
the productivity due to the investment. The "cost
of production" of goods in the case contemplated is to
an appreciable, but indeterminable, extent a cost
-----File: 318.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------------
of production of vendibility--an outcome which is
often of doubtful service to the body of consumers,
and which often counts in the aggregate as waste.
The material serviceability of the means employed
in industry, that is to say the functioning of industrial
capital in the service of the community at
large, stands in no necessary or consistent relation to
the gainfulness of capital in the pecuniary respect. Productivity
can accordingly not be predicated of pecuniary
capital. It follows that productivity theories of interest
should be as difficult to maintain as productivity theories
of the gains of the pecuniary employments, the two
resting on the same grounds.

It is, further, to be remarked that pecuniary capital
and industrial capital do not coincide in respect of the
concrete things comprised under each. From this and
from the considerations already indicated above, it follows
that the magnitude of pecuniary capital may vary
independently of variations in the magnitude of industrial
capital--not indefinitely, perhaps, but within a
range which, in its nature, is indeterminate. Pecuniary
capital is a matter of market values, while industrial capital
is, in the last analysis, a matter of mechanical
efficiency, or rather of mechanical effects not reducible to
a common measure or a collective magnitude. So far as
the latter may be spoken of as a homogenous aggregate--itself
a doubtful point at best--the two categories
of capital are disparate magnitudes, which
can be mediated only through a process of valuation
conditioned by other circumstances besides the
mechanical efficiency of the material means valued.
Market values being a psychological outcome, it follows
that pecuniary capital, an aggregate of market values,
may vary in magnitude with a freedom which gives
-----File: 319.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
the whole an air of caprice,--such as psychological
phenomena, particularly the psychological phenomena
of crowds, frequently present, and such as becomes
strikingly noticeable in times of panic or of
speculative inflation. On the other hand, industrial
capital, being a matter of mechanical contrivances and
adaptation, cannot similarly vary through a revision of
valuations. If it is taken as an aggregate, it is a physical
magnitude, and as such it does not alter its complexion
or its mechanical efficiency in response to the
greater or less degree of appreciation with which it is
viewed. Capital pecuniarily considered rests on a basis
of subjective value; capital industrially considered rests
on material circumstances reducible to objective terms
of mechanical, chemical and physiological effect.

The point has frequently been noted that it is impossible
to get at the aggregate social (industrial) capital
by adding up the several items of individual (pecuniary)
capital. A reason for this, apart from variations in the
market values of given material means of production, is
that pecuniary capital comprises not only material things
but also conventional facts, psychological phenomena
not related in any rigid way to material means
of production,--as <i>e.g.</i>, good will, fashions, customs,
prestige, effrontery, personal credit. Whatever ownership
touches, and whatever affords ground for pecuniary
discretion, may be turned to account for pecuniary
gain and may therefore be comprised in the aggregate
of pecuniary capital. Ownership, the basis of pecuniary
capital, being itself a conventional fact, that is to say
a matter of habits of thought, it is intelligible that phenomena
of convention and opinion should figure in an
inventory of pecuniary capital; whereas, industrial capital
being of a mechanical character, conventional cir-*
-----File: 320.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\majolo\Cosmas\Hermit00\----------------
*cumstances do not affect it--except as the future
production of material means to replace the existing outfit
may be guided by convention--and items having but a
conventional existence are, therefore, not comprised in
its aggregate. The disparity between pecuniary and industrial
capital, therefore, is something more than a
matter of an arbitrarily chosen point of view, as some
recent discussions of the capital concept would have us
believe; just as the difference between the pecuniary
and the industrial employments, which are occupied
with the one or the other category of capital, means
something more than the same thing under different
aspects.

<tb>

But the distinction here attempted has a farther bearing,
beyond the possible correction of a given point in
the theory of distribution. Modern economic science is
to an increasing extent concerning itself with the question
of what men do and how and why they do it, as
contrasted with the older question of how Nature, working
through human nature, maintains a favorable balance
in the output of goods. Neither the practical questions
of our generation, nor the pressing theoretical questions
of the science, run on the adequacy or equity of the
share that goes to any class in the normal case. The
questions are rather such realistic ones as these: Why do
we, now and again, have hard times and unemployment
in the midst of excellent resources, high efficiency and
plenty of unmet wants? Why is one-half our consumable
product contrived for consumption that yields
no material benefit? Why are large co√∂rdinations of industry,
which greatly reduce cost of production, a cause
of perplexity and alarm? Why is the family disintegrating
among the industrial classes, at the same time that the
-----File: 321.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------------
wherewithal to maintain it is easier to compass? Why
are large and increasing portions of the community penniless
in spite of a scale of remuneration which is very
appreciably above the subsistence minimum? Why is
there a widespread disaffection among the intelligent
workmen who ought to know better? These and the like
questions, being questions of fact, are not to be answered
on the grounds of normal equivalence. Perhaps it might
better be said that they have so often been answered on
those grounds, without any approach to disposing of
them, that the outlook for help in that direction has
ceased to have a serious meaning. These are, to borrow
Professor Clark's phrase, questions to be answered on
dynamic, not on static grounds. They are questions of
conduct and sentiment, and so far as their solution is
looked for at the hands of economists it must be looked
for along the line of the bearing which economic life
has upon the growth of sentiment and canons of conduct.
That is to say, they are questions of the bearing
of economic life upon the cultural changes that are going
forward.

For the present it is the vogue to hold that economic
life, broadly, conditions the rest of social organization
or the constitution of society. This vogue of the proposition
will serve as excuse from going into an examination
of the grounds on which it may be justified, as it
is scarcely necessary to persuade any economist that it
has substantial merits even if he may not accept it in
an unqualified form. What the Marxists have named
the "Materialistic Conception of History" is assented
to with less and less qualification by those who make
the growth of culture their subject of inquiry. This
materialistic conception says that institutions are shaped
by economic conditions; but, as it left the hands of the
-----File: 322.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
Marxists, and as it still functions in the hands of many
who knew not Marx, it has very little to say regarding
the efficient force, the channels, or the methods by which
the economic situation is conceived to have its effect upon
institutions. What answer the early Marxists gave to
this question, of how the economic situation shapes institutions,
was to the effect that the causal connection
lies through a selfish, calculating class interest. But,
while class interest may count for much in the outcome,
this answer is plainly not a competent one, since, for one
thing, institutions by no means change with the alacrity
which the sole efficiency of a reasoned class interest would
require.

Without discrediting the claim that class interest counts
for something in the shaping of institutions, and to avoid
getting entangled in preliminaries, it may be said that
institutions are of the nature of prevalent habits of
thought, and that therefore the force which shapes institutions
is the force or forces which shape the habits of
thought prevalent in the community. But habits of
thought are the outcome of habits of life. Whether it
is intentionally directed to the education of the individual
or not, the discipline of daily life acts to alter or re√´nforce
the received habits of thought, and so acts to alter or
fortify the received institutions under which men live.
And the direction in which, on the whole, the alteration
proceeds is conditioned by the trend of the discipline of
daily life. The point here immediately at issue is the
divergent trend of this discipline in those occupations
which are prevailingly of an industrial character, as contrasted
with those which are prevailingly of a pecuniary
character. So far as regards the different cultural outcome
to be looked for on the basis of the present economic
situation as contrasted with the past, therefore, the ques-*
-----File: 323.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
*tion immediately in hand is as to the greater or less
degree in which occupations are differentiated into industrial
and pecuniary in the present as compared with
the past.

The characteristic feature which is currently held to
differentiate the existing economic situation from that
out of which the present has developed, or out of which
it is emerging, is the prevalence of the machine industry
with the consequent larger and more highly specialised
organisation of the market and of the industrial
force and plant. As has been pointed out above, and as
is well enough known from the current discussions of
the economists, industrial life is organised on a pecuniary
basis and managed from the pecuniary side. This,
of course, is true in a degree both of the present and of
the nearer past, back at least as far as the Middle Ages.
But the larger scope of organisations in modern industry
means that the pecuniary management has been gradually
passing into the hands of a relatively decreasing
class, whose contact with the industrial classes proper
grows continually less immediate. The distinction between
employments above spoken of is in an increasing
degree coming to coincide with a differentiation of occupations
and of economic classes. Some degree of such
specialisation and differentiation there has, of course,
been, one might almost say, always. But in our time,
in many branches of industry, the specialisation has been
carried so far that large bodies of the working population
have but an incidental contact with the business
side of the enterprise, while a minority have little if any
other concern with the enterprise than its pecuniary
management. This was not true, <i>e.g.</i>, at the time when
the undertaker was still salesman, purchasing agent, business
manager, foreman of the shop, and master work-*
-----File: 324.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------------
*man. Still less was it true in the days of the self-sufficing
manor or household, or in the days of the closed
town industry. Neither is it true in our time of what
we call the backward or old-fashioned industries. These
latter have not been and are not organised on a large
scale, with a consistent division of labor between the
owners and business managers on the one side and the
operative employees on the other. Our standing illustrations
of this less highly organised class of industries are
the surviving handicrafts and the common run of farming
as carried on by relatively small proprietors. In that
earlier phase of economic life, out of which the modern
situation has gradually grown, all the men engaged had
to be constantly on their guard, in a pecuniary sense, and
were constantly disciplined in the husbanding of their
means and in the driving of bargains,--as is still true,
<i>e. g.</i>, of the American farmer. The like was formerly
true also of the consumer, in his purchases, to a greater
extent than at present. A good share of the daily attention
of those who were engaged in the handicrafts was
still perforce given to the pecuniary or business side of
their trade. But for that great body of industry which
is conventionally recognised as eminently modern, specialisation
of function has gone so far as, in great measure,
to exempt the operative employees from taking thought
of pecuniary matters.

Now, as to the bearing of all this upon cultural changes
that are in progress or in the outlook. Leaving the
"backward," relatively unspecialised, industries on one
side, as being of an equivocal character for the point in
hand and as not differing characteristically from the corresponding
industries in the past so far as regards their
disciplinary value; modern occupations may, for the sake
of the argument, be broadly distinguished, as economic
-----File: 325.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\A. B. Dahl\Hermit00\---------------
employments have been distinguished above, into business
and industrial. The modern industrial and the modern
business occupations are fairly comparable as regards the
degree of intelligence required in both, if it be borne in
mind that the former occupations comprise the highly
trained technological experts and engineers as well as the
highly skilled mechanics. The two classes of occupations
differ in that the men in the pecuniary occupations
work within the lines and under the guidance of the great
institution of ownership, with its ramifications of custom,
perogative[**p3: prerogative], and legal right; whereas those in the
industrial occupations are, in their work, relatively free
from the constraint of this conventional norm of truth
and validity. It is, of course, not true that the work of
the latter class lies outside the reach of the institution of
ownership; but it is true that, in the heat and strain of
the work, when the agent's powers and attention are
fully taken up with the work which he has in hand, that
of which he has perforce to take cognisance is not conventional
law, but the conditions impersonally imposed
by the nature of material things. This is the meaning
of the current commonplace that the required close and
continuous application of the operative in mechanical
industry bars him out of all chance for an all-around
development of the cultural graces and amenities. It is
the periods of close attention and hard work that seem
to count for most in the formation of habits of thought.

An <i>a priori</i> argument as to what cultural effects should
naturally follow from such a difference in discipline
between occupations, past and present, would probably
not be convincing, as <i>a priori</i> arguments from half-authenticated
premises commonly are not. And the experiments
along this line which later economic developments
have so far exhibited have been neither neat
-----File: 326.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
enough, comprehensive enough, nor long continued
enough to give definite results. Still, there is something
to be said under this latter head, even if this something
may turn out to be somewhat familiar.

It is, <i>e.g.</i> a commonplace of current vulgar discussions
of existing economic questions, that the classes
engaged in the modern mechanical or factory industries
are improvident and apparently incompetent to take care
of the pecuniary details of their own life. In this indictment
may well be included not only factory hands, but
the general class of highly skilled mechanics, inventors,
technological experts. The rule does not hold in any
hard and fast way, but there seems to be a substantial
ground of truth in the indictment in this general form.
This will be evident on comparison of the present factory
population with the class of handicraftsmen of the older
culture whom they have displaced, as also on comparison
with the farming population of the present time, especially
the small proprietors of this and other countries.
The inferiority which is currently conceded to the modern
industrial classes in this respect is not due to scantier opportunities
for saving, whether they are compared with
the earlier handicraftsmen or with the modern farmer or
peasant. This phenomenon is commonly discussed in
terms which impute to the improvident industrial classes
something in the way of total depravity, and there is
much preaching of thrift and steady habits. But the
preaching of thrift and self-help, unremitting as it is, is
not producing an appreciable effect. The trouble seems
to run deeper than exhortation can reach. It seems to be
of the nature of habit rather than of reasoned conviction.
Other causes may be present and may be competent
partially to explain the improvidence of these classes;
but the inquiry is at least a pertinent one; how far the
-----File: 327.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------------
absence of property and thrift among them may be
traceable to the relative absence of pecuniary training in
the discipline of their daily life. If, as the general lie
of the subject would indicate, this peculiar pecuniary
situation of the industrial classes is in any degree due
to comprehensive disciplinary causes, there is material
in it for an interesting economic inquiry.

The surmise that the trouble with the industrial class
is something of this character is strengthened by another
feature of modern vulgar life, to which attention is directed
as a further, and, for the present, a concluding
illustration of the character of the questions that are
touched by the distinction here spoken for. The most
insidious and most alarming malady, as well as the most
perplexing and unprecedented, that threatens the modern
social and political structure is what is vaguely called
socialism. The point of danger to the social structure,
and at the same time the substantial core of the socialistic
disaffection, is a growing disloyalty to the institution
of property, aided and abetted as it is by a similarly
growing lack of deference and affection for other conventional
features of social structure. The classes affected
by socialistic vagaries are not consistently averse
to a competent organisation and control of society, particularly
not in the economic respect, but they are averse
to organisation and control on conventional lines. The
sense of solidarity does not seem to be either defective
or in abeyance, but the ground of solidarity is new and
unexpected. What their constructive ideals may be need
not concern nor detain us; they are vague and inconsistent
and for the most part negative. Their disaffection
has been set down to discontent with their lot by
comparison with others, and to a mistaken view of their
own interests; and much and futile effort has been spent
-----File: 328.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
in showing them the error of their ways of thinking.
But what the experience of the past suggests that we
should expect under the guidance of such motives and
reasoning as these would be a demand for a redistribution
of property, a reconstitution of the conventions of
ownership on such new lines as the apprehended interests
of these classes would seem to dictate. But such is
not the trend of socialistic thinking, which contemplates
rather the elimination of the institution of property. To
the socialists property or ownership does not seem inevitable
or inherent in the nature of things; to those who
criticise and admonish them it commonly does.

Compare them in this respect with other classes who
have been moved by hardship or discontent, whether
well or ill advised, to put forth denunciations and demands
for radical economic changes; as <i>e.g.</i>, the American
farmers in their several movements, of grangerism,
populism, and the like. These have been loud enough in
their denunciations and complaints, and they have been
accused of being socialistic in their demand for a virtual
redistribution of property. They have not felt the justice
of the accusation, however, and it is to be noted that
their demands have consistently run on a rehabilitation
of property on some new basis of distribution, and have
been uniformly put forth with the avowed purpose of
bettering the claimants in point of ownership. Ownership,
property "honestly" acquired, has been sacred to
the rural malcontents, here and elsewhere; what they
have aspired to do has been to remedy what they have
conceived to be certain abuses under the institution,
without questioning the institution itself.

Not so with the socialists, either in this country or
elsewhere. Now, the spread of socialistic sentiment
shows a curious tendency to affect those classes particu-*
-----File: 329.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\aagam\Hermit00\--------------------
*larly who are habitually employed in the specialised industrial
occupations, and are thereby in great part exempt
from the intellectual discipline of pecuniary management.
Among these men, who by the circumstances of their
daily life are brought to do their serious and habitual
thinking in other than pecuniary terms, it looks as if the
ownership preconception were becoming obsolescent
through disuse. It is the industrial population, in the
modern sense, and particularly the more intelligent and
skilled men employed in the mechanical industries, that
are most seriously and widely affected. With exceptions
both ways, but with a generality that is not to be denied,
the socialistic disaffection spreads through the industrial
towns, chiefly and most potently among the better classes
of operatives in the mechanical employments; whereas
the relatively indigent and unintelligent regions and
classes, which the differentiation between pecuniary and
industrial occupations has not reached, are relatively free
from it. In like manner the upper and middle classes,
whose employments are of a pecuniary character, if any,
are also not seriously affected; and when avowed socialistic
sentiment is met with among these upper and middle
classes it commonly turns out to be merely a humanitarian
aspiration for a more "equitable" redistribution of
wealth--a readjustment of ownership under some new
and improved method of control--not a contemplation
of the traceless disappearance of ownership.

Socialism, in the sense in which the word connotes a
subversion of the economic foundations of modern
culture, appears to be found only sporadically and uncertainly
outside the limits, in time and space, of the
discipline exercised by the modern mechanical, non-pecuniary
occupations. This state of the case need of
course not be due solely to the disciplinary effects of
-----File: 330.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------------
the industrial employments, nor even solely to effects
traceable to those employments whether in the way of
disciplinary results, selective development, or what not.
Other factors, particularly factors of an ethnic character,
seem to co√∂perate to the result indicated; but, so far as
evidence bearing on the point is yet in hand and has
been analysed, it indicates that this differentiation of
occupations is a necessary requisite to the growth of a
consistent body of socialistic sentiment; and the indication
is also that wherever this differentiation prevails
in such a degree of accentuation and affects such considerable
and compact bodies of people as to afford
ground for a consistent growth of common sentiment, a
result is some form of iconoclastic socialism. The differentiation
may of course have a selective as well as a
disciplinary effect upon the population affected, and an
off-hand separation of these two modes of influence can
of course not be made. In any case, the two modes of
influence seem to converge to the outcome indicated;
and, for the present purpose of illustration simply, the
tracing out of the two strands of sequence in the case
neither can nor need be undertaken. By force of this
differentiation, in one way and another, the industrial
classes are learning to think in terms of material cause
and effect, to the neglect of prescription and conventional
grounds of validity; just as, in a faintly incipient
way, the economists are also learning to do in their discussion
of the life of these classes. The resulting decay
of the popular sense of conventional validity of course
extends to other matters than the pecuniary conventions
alone, with the outcome that the socialistically affected
industrial classes are pretty uniformly affected with an
effortless iconoclasm in other directions as well. For the
discipline to which their work and habits of life subject
-----File: 331.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
them gives not so much a training away from the pecuniary
conventions, specifically, as a positive and somewhat
unmitigated training in methods of observation and inference
proceeding on grounds alien to all conventional
validity. But the practical experiment going on in the
specialisation of discipline, in the respect contemplated,
appears still to be near its beginning, and the growth of
aberrant views and habits of thought due to the peculiar
disciplinary trend of this late and unprecedented specialisation
of occupations has not yet had time to work itself
clear.

The effects of the like one-sided discipline are similarly
visible in the highly irregular, conventionally indefensible
attitude of the industrial classes in the current
labor and wage disputes, not of an avowedly socialistic
aim. So also as regards the departure from the ancient
norm in such non-economic, or secondarily economic matters
as the family relation and responsibility, where the
disintegration of conventionalities in the industrial towns
is said to threaten the foundations of domestic life and
morality; and again as regards the growing inability of
men trained to materialistic, industrial habits of thought
to appreciate, or even to apprehend, the meaning of religious
appeals and consolations that proceed on the old-fashioned
conventional or metaphysical grounds of
validity. But these and other like directions in which
the cultural effects of the modern specialisation of occupations,
whether in industry or in business, may be traceable
can not be followed up here.

ON THE NATURE OF CAPITAL[1]


I. <sc>The Productivity of Capital Goods</sc>

It has been usual in expositions of economic theory to
speak of capital as an array of "productive goods."
What is immediately had in mind in this expression, as
well as in the equivalent "capital goods," is the industrial
equipment, primarily the mechanical appliances employed
in the processes of industry. When the productive
efficiency of these and of other subsidiary classes of
capital goods is subjected to further analysis, it is not
unusual to trace it back to the productive labor of the
workmen, the labor of the individual workman being the
ultimate productive factor in the commonly accepted systems
of theory. The current theories of production, as
also those of distribution, are drawn in individualistic
terms, particularly when these theories are based on
hedonistic premises, as they commonly are.

Now, whatever may or may not be true for human
conduct in some other bearing, in the economic respect
man has never lived an isolated, self-sufficient life as an
individual, either actually or potentially. Humanly
speaking, such a thing is impossible. Neither an individual
person nor a single household, nor a single line of
descent, can maintain its life in isolation. Economically
speaking, this is the characteristic trait of humanity that
separates mankind from the other animals. The life-history
of the race has been a life-history of human com-*

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly Journal of
Economics</i>, Vol. XXII, Aug., 1908.]
-----File: 333.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
*munities, of more or less considerable size, with more or
less of group solidarity, and with more or less of cultural
continuity over successive generations. The phenomena
of human life occur only in this form.

This continuity, congruity, or coherence of the group,
is of an immaterial character. It is a matter of knowledge,
usage, habits of life and habits of thought, not a
matter of mechanical continuity or contact, or even of
consanguinity. Wherever a human community is met
with, as, <i>e.g.</i>, among any of the peoples of the lower cultures,
it is found in possession of something in the way
of a body of technological knowledge,--knowledge serviceable
and requisite to the quest of a livelihood, comprising
at least such elementary acquirements as language, the
use of fire, of a cutting edge, of a pointed stick, of some
tool for piercing, of some form of cord, thong, or fiber,
together with some skill in the making of knots and lashings.
Co√∂rdinate with this knowledge of ways and
means, there is also uniformly present some matter-of-fact
knowledge of the physical behavior of the materials
with which men have to deal in the quest of a livelihood,
beyond what any one individual has learned or can learn
by his own experience alone. This information and proficiency
in the ways and means of life vests in the group
at large; and, apart from accretions borrowed from other
groups, it is the product of the given group, though not
produced by any single generation. It may be called the
immaterial equipment, or, by a license of speech, the intangible
assets[2] of the community; and, in the early days
at least, this is far and away the most important and

[Footnote 2: "Assets" is, of course, not to be taken literally in this connection.
The term properly covers a pecuniary concept, not an industrial
(technological) one, and it connotes ownership as well as
value; and it will be used in this literal sense when, in a later
article, ownership and investment come into the discussion. In]*
-----File: 334.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\maggiemeh\aagam\Hermit00\---------
consequential category of the community's assets or equipment.
Without access to such a common stock of immaterial
equipment no individual and no fraction of the
community can make a living, much less make an advance.
Such a stock of knowledge and practice is perhaps
held loosely and informally; but it is held as a common
stock, pervasively, by the group as a body, in its
corporate capacity, as one might say; and it is transmitted
and augmented in and by the group, however loose and
haphazard the transmission may be conceived to be, not
by individuals and in single lines of inheritance.

The requisite knowledge and proficiency of ways and
means is a product, perhaps a by-product, of the life of
the community at large; and it can also be maintained
and retained only by the community at large. Whatever
may be true for the unsearchable prehistoric phases of
the life-history of the race, it appears to be true for the
most primitive human groups and phases of which there
is available information that the mass of technological
knowledge possessed by any community, and necessary to
its maintenance and to the maintenance of each of its
members or subgroups, is too large a burden for any one
individual or any single line of descent to carry. This
holds true, of course, all the more rigorously and consistently,
the more advanced the "state of the industrial
arts" may be. But it seems to hold true with a generality
that is fairly startling, that whenever a given cultural
community is broken up or suffers a serious diminution
of numbers, its technological heritage deteriorates and
dwindles, even though it may have been apparently meager
enough before. On the other hand, it seems to hold

*[Footnote: the present connection it is used figuratively, for want of a better
term, to convey the connotation of value and serviceability without
thereby implying ownership.]
-----File: 335.png---\Pitirim\Readingftw\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
true with a similar uniformity that, when an individual
member or a fraction of a community on what we call a
lower stage of economic development is drawn away and
trained and instructed in the ways of a larger and more
efficient technology, and is then thrown back into his
home community, such an individual or fraction proves
unable to make head against the technological bent of the
community at large or even to create a serious diversion.
Slight, perhaps transient, and gradually effective technological
consequences may result from such an experiment;
but they become effective by diffusion and assimilation
through the body of the community, not in any marked
degree in the way of an exceptional efficiency on the part
of the individual or fraction which has been subjected to
exceptional training. And inheritance in technological
matters runs not in the channels of consanguinity, but in
those of tradition and habituation, which are necessarily
as wide as the scheme of life of the community. Even in
a relatively small and primitive community the mass of
detail comprised in its knowledge and practice of ways
and means is large,--too large for any one individual or
household to become competently expert in it all; and its
ramifications are extensive and diverse, at the same time
that all these ramifications bear, directly or indirectly, on
the life and work of each member of the community.
Neither the standard and routine of living nor the daily
work of any individual in the community would remain
the same after the introduction of an appreciable change,
for good or ill, in any branch of the community's equipment
of technological expedients. If the community
grows larger, to the dimensions of a modern civilised people,
and this immaterial equipment grows proportionately
great and various, then it will become increasingly difficult
to trace the connection between any given change in
-----File: 336.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
technological detail and the fortunes of any given obscure
member of the community. But it is at least safe to say
that an increase in the volume and complexity of the
body of technological knowledge and practice does not
progressively emancipate the life and work of the individual
from its dominion.

The complement of technological knowledge so held,
used, and transmitted in the life of the community is, of
course, made up out of the experience of individuals.
Experience, experimentation, habit, knowledge, initiative,
are phenomena of individual life, and it is necessarily
from this source that the community's common stock is
all derived. The possibility of its growth lies in the feasibility
of accumulating knowledge gained by individual
experience and initiative, and therefore it lies in the feasibility
of one individual's learning from the experience of
another. But the initiative and technological enterprise
of individuals, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as shows itself in inventions and
discoveries of more and better ways and means, proceeds
on and enlarges the accumulated wisdom of the past.
Individual initiative has no chance except on the ground
afforded by the common stock, and the achievements of
such initiative are of no effect except as accretions to the
common stock. And the invention or discovery so
achieved always embodies so much of what is already
given that the creative contribution of the inventor or
discoverer is trivial by comparison.

In any known phase of culture this common stock of
intangible, technological equipment is relatively large and
complex,--<i>i.e.</i>, relatively to the capacity of any individual
member to create or to use it; and the history of its
growth and use is the history of the development of material
civilisation. It is a knowledge of ways and means,
and is embodied in the material contrivances and proc-*
-----File: 337.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\maggiemeh\Cosmas\Hermit00\----------
*esses by means of which the members of the community
make their living. Only by such means does technological
efficiency go into effect. These "material contrivances"
("capital goods," material equipment) are such
things as tools, vessels, vehicles, raw materials, buildings,
ditches, and the like, including the land in use; but they
include also, and through the greater part of the early
development chiefly, the useful minerals, plants, and animals.
To say that these minerals, plants, and animals are
useful--in other words, that they are economic goods--means
that they have been brought within the sweep of
the community's knowledge of ways and means.

In the relatively early stages of primitive culture the
useful plants and minerals are, no doubt, made use of in
a wild state, as, <i>e.g.</i>, fish and timber have continued to be
used. Yet in so far as they are useful they are unmistakably
to be counted in among the material equipment
("tangible assets") of the community. The case is well
illustrated by the relation of the Plains Indians to the
buffalo, and by the northwest coast Indians to the salmon,
on the one hand, and by the use of a wild flora by such
communities as the Coahuilla Indians,[3] the Australian
blacks, or the Andamanese, on the other hand.

But with the current of time, experience, and initiative,
domesticated (that is to say improved) plants and animals
come to take the first place. We have then such "technological
expedients" in the first rank as the many species
and varieties of domestic animals, and more particularly
still the various grains, fruits, root-crops, and the like,
virtually all of which were created by man for human
use; or perhaps a more scrupulously veracious account
would say that they were in the main created by the
women, through long ages of workmanlike selection and

[Footnote 3: Barrows.]
-----File: 338.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
cultivation. These things, of course, are useful because
men have learned their use, and their use, so far as it
has been learned, has been learned by protracted and
voluminous experience and experimentation, proceeding
at each step on the accumulated achievements of the past.
Other things, which may in time come to exceed these in
usefulness are still useless, economically non-existent, on
the early levels of culture, because of what men in that
time have not yet learned.

<tb>

While this immaterial equipment of industry, the intangible
assets of the community, have apparently always
been relatively very considerable and are always mainly
in the keeping of the community at large, the material
equipment, the tangible assets, on the other hand, have,
in the early stages (say the earlier 90 per cent.) of the
life-history of human culture, been relatively slight, and
have apparently been held somewhat loosely by individuals
or household groups. This material equipment is
relatively very slight in the earlier phases of technological
development, and the tenure by which it is held is apparently
vague and uncertain. At a relatively primitive
phase of the development, and under ordinary conditions
of climate and surroundings, the possession of the concrete
articles ("capital goods") needed to turn the commonplace
knowledge of ways and means to account is a
matter of slight consequence,--contrary to the view commonly
spoken for by the economists of the classical line.
Given the commonplace technological knowledge and the
commonplace training,--and these are given by common
notoriety and the habituation of daily life,--the acquisition,
construction, or usufruct of the slender material
equipment needed arranges itself almost as a matter of
-----File: 339.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
course, more particularly where this material equipment
does not include a stock of domestic animals or a plantation
of domesticated trees and vegetables. Under given
circumstances a relatively primitive technological scheme
may involve some large items of material equipment, as
the buffalo pens (<i>piskun</i>) of the Blackfoot Indians or the
salmon weirs of the river Indians of the northwest coast.
Such items of material equipment are then likely to be
held and worked collectively, either by the community at
large or by subgroups of a considerable size. Under ordinary,
more generally prevalent conditions, it appears
that even after a relatively great advance has been made in
the cultivation of crops the requisite industrial equipment
is not a matter of serious concern, particularly so aside
from the tilled ground and the cultivated trees, as is indicated
by the singularly loose and inconsequential notions
of ownership prevalent among peoples occupying such a
stage of culture. A primitive stage of communism is
not known.

But as the common stock of technological knowledge
increases in volume, range, and efficiency, the material
equipment whereby this knowledge of ways and means is
put into effect grows greater, more considerable relatively
to the capacity of the individual. And so soon, or in so
far, as the technological development falls into such shape
as to require a relatively large unit of material equipment
for the effective pursuit of industry, or such as otherwise
to make the possession of the requisite material equipment
a matter of consequence, so as seriously to handicap
the individuals who are without these material means, and
to place the current possessors of such equipment at a
marked advantage, then the strong arm intervenes, property
rights apparently begin to fall into definite shape, the
-----File: 340.png---\Pitirim\rascal26\maggiemeh\aagam\Hermit00\-----------
principles of ownership gather force and consistency, and
men begin to accumulate capital goods and take measures
to make them secure.

An appreciable advance in the industrial arts is commonly
followed or accompanied by an increase of population.
The difficulty of procuring a livelihood may be no
greater after such an increase; it may even be less; but
there results a relative curtailment of the available area
and raw materials, and commonly also an increased accessibility
of the several portions of the community. A
wide-reaching control becomes easier. At the same time
a larger unit of material equipment is needed for the
effective pursuit of industry. As this situation develops,
it becomes worth while--this is to say, it becomes feasible--for
the individual with the strong arm to engross,
or "corner," the usufruct of the commonplace knowledge
of ways and means by taking over such of the requisite
material as may be relatively scarce and relatively indispensable
for procuring a livelihood under the current
state of the industrial arts.[4] Circumstances of space
and numbers prevent escape from the new technological
situation. The commonplace knowledge of ways and
means cannot be turned to account, under the new conditions,
without a material equipment adapted to the then
current state of the industrial arts; and such a suitable
material equipment is no longer a slight matter, to be
compassed by workmanlike initiative and application.
<i>Beati possidentes.</i>

The emphasis of the technological situation, as one

[Footnote 4: Motives of exploit and emulation, no doubt, play a serious
part in bringing on the practice of ownership and in establishing
the principles on which it rests; but this play of motives and the
concomitant growth of institutions cannot be taken up here. <i>Cf.</i>
<i>The Theory of the Leisure Class</i>, chaps. i, ii, iii.]
-----File: 341.png---\Pitirim\jcricket\maggiemeh\Cosmas\Hermit00\----------
might say, may fall now on one line of material items,
now on another, according as the exigencies of climate,
topography, flora and fauna, density of population, and
the like, may decide. So also, under the rule of the same
exigencies, the early growth of property rights and of the
principles (habits of thought) of ownership may settle on
one or another line of material items, according as one or
another affords the strategic advantage for engrossing the
current technological efficiency of the community.

Should the technological situation, the state of the industrial
arts, be such as to throw the strategic emphasis on
manual labor, on workmanlike skill and application, and
if at the same time the growth of population has made
land relatively scarce, or hostile contact with other communities
has made it impracticable for members of the
community to range freely over outlying tracts, then it
would be expected that the growth of ownership should
take the direction primarily of slavery, or of some equivalent
form of servitude, so effecting a na√Øve and direct
monopolistic control of the current knowledge of ways
and means.[5] Whereas if the development has taken such
a turn, and the community is so placed as to make the
quest of a livelihood a matter of the natural increase of
flocks and herds, then it should reasonably be expected
that these items of equipment will be the chief and primary
subject of property rights. In point of fact, it appears
that a pastoral culture commonly involves also some
degree of servitude, along with the ownership of flocks
and herds.

Under different circumstances the mechanical appliances
of industry, or the tillable land, might come into the
position of strategic advantage, and might come in for the

[Footnote 5: <i>Cf.</i> H. Nieboer, <i>Slavery as an Industrial System</i>, chap. iv,
sect. 12.]
-----File: 342.png---\Pitirim\ianh44\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
foremost place in men's consideration as objects of ownership.
The evidence afforded by the known (relatively)
primitive cultures and communities seems to indicate that
slaves and cattle have in this way come into the primacy
as objects of ownership at an earlier period in the growth
of material civilisation than land or the mechanical appliances.
And it seems similarly evident--more so, indeed--that
land has on the whole preceded the mechanical
equipment as the stronghold of ownership and the means
of engrossing the community's industrial efficiency.

It is not until a late period in the life-history of material
civilisation that ownership of the industrial equipment, in
the narrower sense in which that phrase is commonly employed,
comes to be the dominant and typical method of
engrossing the immaterial equipment. Indeed, it is a
consummation which has been reached only a very few
times even partially, and only once with such a degree of
finality as to leave the fact indisputable. If it may be
said, loosely, that mastery through the ownership of
slaves, cattle, or land comes on in force only after the
economic development has run through some nine-tenths
of its course hitherto, then it may be said likewise that
some ninety-nine one-hundredths of this course of development
had been completed before the ownership of the
mechanical equipment came into undisputed primacy as
the basis of pecuniary dominion. So late an innovation,
indeed, is this modern institution of "capitalism,"--the
predominant ownership of industrial capital as we know
it,--and yet so intimate a fact is it in our familiar scheme
of life, that we have some difficulty in seeing it in perspective
at all, and we find ourselves hesitating between denying
its existence, on the one hand, and affirming it to be
a fact of nature antecedent to all human institutions, on
the other hand.
-----File: 343.png---\Pitirim\tfkowal\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------

In so speaking of the ownership of industrial equipment
as being an institution for cornering the community's
intangible assets, there is conveyed an unavoidably
implied, though unintended, note of condemnation. Such
an implication of merit or demerit is an untoward circumstance
in any theoretical inquiry. Any sentimental
bias, whether of approval or disapproval, aroused by such
an implied censure, must unavoidably hamper the dispassionate
pursuit of the argument. To mitigate the effect
of this jarring note as far as may be, therefore, it will be
expedient to turn back for a moment to other, more primitive
and remoter forms of the institution,--as slavery and
landed wealth,--and so reach the modern facts of industrial
capital by a roundabout and gradual approach.

These ancient institutions of ownership, slavery and
landed wealth, are matters of history. Considered as
dominant factors in the community's scheme of life, their
record is completed; and it needs no argument to enforce
the proposition that it is a record of economic dominion
by the owners of the slaves or the land, as the case may
be. The effect of slavery in its best day, and of landed
wealth in medi√¶val and early modern times, was to make
the community's industrial efficiency serve the needs of
the slave-owners in the one case and of the land-owners
in the other. The effect of these institutions in this respect
is not questioned now, except in such sporadic and
apologetical fashion as need not detain the argument.

But the fact that such was the direct and immediate
effect of these institutions of ownership in their time by
no means involves the instant condemnation of the institutions
in question. It is quite possible to argue that slavery
and landed wealth, each in its due time and due cultural
setting, have served the amelioration of the lot of
man and the advance of human culture. What these
-----File: 344.png---\Pitirim\tfkowal\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
arguments may be that aim to show the merits of slavery
and landed wealth as a means of cultural advance does
not concern the present inquiry, neither do the merits of
the case in which the arguments are offered. The matter
is referred to here to call to mind that any similar theoretical
outcome of an analysis of the productivity of
"capital goods" need not be admitted to touch the merits
of the case in controversy between the socialistic critics of
capitalism and the spokesmen of law and order.

The nature of landed wealth, in point of economic
theory, especially as regards its productivity, has been
sifted with the most jealous precautions and the most
tenacious logic during the past century; and any economic
student can easily review the course of the argument
whereby that line of economic theory has been run to
earth. It is only necessary here to shift the point of
view slightly to bring the whole argument concerning the
rent of land to bear on the present question. Rent is of
the nature of a differential gain, resting on a differential
advantage in point of productivity of the industry employed
upon or about it. This differential advantage
attaching to a given parcel of land may be a differential
as against another parcel or as against industry applied
apart from land. The differential advantage attaching
to agricultural land--<i>e.g.</i>, as against industry at large--rests
on certain broad peculiarities of the technological
situation. Among them are such peculiarities as these:
the human species, or the fraction of it concerned in the
case, is numerous, relatively to the extent of its habitat;
the methods of getting a living, as hitherto elaborated, the
ways and means of life, make use of certain crop-plants
and certain domestic animals. Apart from such conditions,
taken for granted in arguments concerning agricultural
rent, there could manifestly be no differential ad-*
-----File: 345.png---\Pitirim\tfkowal\VerenaM\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------
*vantage attaching to land, and no production of rent.
With increased command of methods of transportation,
the agricultural lands of England, <i>e.g.</i>, and of Europe at
large, declined in value, not because these lands became
less fertile, but because an equivalent result could more
advantageously be got by a new method. So, again, the
flint- and amber-bearing regions that are now Danish
and Swedish territory about the waters at the entrance
to the Baltic were in the neolithic culture of northern
Europe the most favored and valuable lands within that
cultural region. But, with the coming of the metals and
the relative decline of the amber trade, they began to fall
behind in the scale of productivity and preference. So
also in later time, with the rise of "industry" and the
growth of the technology of communication, urban property
has gained, as contrasted with rural property, and
land placed in an advantageous position relatively to shipping
and railroads has acquired a value and a "productiveness"
which could not be claimed for it apart from
these modern technological expedients.

The argument of the single-tax advocates and other
economists as to the "unearned increment" is sufficiently
familiar, but its ulterior implications have not commonly
been recognised. The unearned increment, it is held, is
produced by the growth of the community in numbers
and in the industrial arts. The contention seems to be
sound, and is commonly accepted; but it has commonly
been overlooked that the argument involves the ulterior
conclusion that all land values and land productivity, including
the "original and indestructible powers of the
soil," are a function of the "state of the industrial art."
It is only within the given technological situation, the
current scheme of ways and means, that any parcel of
land has such productive powers as it has. It is, in other
-----File: 346.png---\Pitirim\tfkowal\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
words, useful only because, and in so far, and in such
manner, as men have learned to make use of it. This is
what brings it into the category of "land," economically
speaking. And the preferential position of the landlord
as a claimant of the "net product" consists in his legal
right to decide whether, how far, and on what terms men
shall put this technological scheme into effect in those
features of it which involve the use of his parcel of land.

<tb>

All this argument concerning the unearned increment
may be carried over, with scarcely a change of phrase, to
the case of "capital goods." The Danish flint supply
was of first-rate economic consequence, for a thousand
years or so, during the stone age; and the polished-flint
utensils of that time were then "capital goods" of inestimable
importance to civilisation, and were possessed of
a "productivity" so serious that the life of mankind in
that world may be said to have been balanced on the fine-ground
edge of those magnificent polished-flint axes. All
that lasted through its technological era. The flint supply
and the mechanical expedients and "capital goods,"
whereby it was turned to account, were valuable and
productive then, but neither before nor after that time.
Under a changed technological situation the capital goods
of that time have become museum exhibits, and their
place in human economy has been taken by technological
expedients which embody another "state of the industrial
arts," the outcome of later and different phases of human
experience. Like the polished-flint ax, the metal utensils
which gradually displaced it and its like in the economy
of the Occidental culture were the product of long experience
and the gradual learning of ways and means. The
steel ax, as well as the flint ax, embodies the same ancient
technological expedient of a cutting edge, as well as
-----File: 347.png---\Pitirim\tfkowal\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
the use of a helve and the efficiency due to the weight of
the tool. And in the case of the one or the other, when
seen in historical perspective and looked at from the point
of view of the community at large, the knowledge of ways
and means embodied in the utensils was the serious and
consequential matter. The construction or acquisition of
the concrete "capital goods" was simply an easy consequence.
It "cost nothing but labor," as Thomas Mun
would say.

Yet it might be argued that each concrete article of
"capital goods" was the product of some one man's
labor, and, as such, its productivity, when put to use, was
but the indirect, ulterior, deferred productiveness of the
maker's labor. But the maker's productivity in the case
was but a function of the immaterial technological equipment
at his command, and that in its turn was the slow
spiritual distillate of the community's time-long experience
and initiative. To the individual producer or owner,
to whom the community's accumulated stock of immaterial
equipment was open by common notoriety, the cost of
the concrete material goods would be the effort involved
in making or getting them and in making good his claim
to them. To his neighbor who had made or acquired no
such parcel of "productive goods," but to whom the resources
of the community, material and immaterial, were
open on the same easy terms, the matter would look very
much the same. He would have no grievance, nor would
he have occasion to seek one. Yet, as a resource in the
maintenance of the community's life and a factor in the
advance of material civilisation, the whole matter would
have a different meaning.

So long, or rather in so far, as the "capital goods"
required to meet the technological demands of the time
were slight enough to be compassed by the common man
-----File: 348.png---\Pitirim\amerisca\VerenaM\Cosmas\Hermit00\------------
with reasonable diligence and proficiency, so long the
draft upon the common stock of immaterial assets by any
one would be no hindrance to any other, and no differential
advantage or disadvantage would emerge. The economic
situation would answer passably to the classical
theory of a free competitive system,--"the obvious and
simple system of natural liberty," which rests on the presumption
of equal opportunity. In a roughly approximate
way, such a situation supervened in the industrial
life of western Europe on the transition from medi√¶val
to modern times, when handicraft and "industrial" enterprise
superseded landed wealth as the chief economic
factor. Within the "industrial system," as distinct from
the privileged non-industrial classes, a man with a modicum
of diligence, initiative, and thrift might make his
way in a tolerable fashion without special advantages in
the way of prescriptive right or accumulated means. The
principle of equal opportunity was, no doubt, met only in
a very rough and dubious fashion; but so favorable became
the conditions in this respect that men came to persuade
themselves in the course of the eighteenth century
that a substantially equitable allotment of opportunities
would result from the abrogation of all prerogatives other
than the ownership of goods. But so precarious and
transient was this approximation to a technologically
feasible system of equal opportunity that, while the liberal
movement which converged upon this great economic reform
was still gathering head, the technological situation
was already outgrowing the possibility of such a scheme
of reform. After the Industrial Revolution came on, it
was no longer true, even in the roughly approximate way
in which it might have been true some time earlier, that
equality before the law, barring property rights, would
mean equal opportunity. In the leading, aggressive in-*
-----File: 349.png---\Pitirim\Ymartin\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
*dustries which were beginning to set the pace for all that
economic system that centered about the market, the unit
of industrial equipment, as required by the new technological
era, was larger than one man could compass by his
own efforts with the free use of the commonplace knowledge
of ways and means. And the growth of business
enterprise progressively made the position of the small,
old-fashioned producer more precarious. But the speculative
theoreticians of that time still saw the phenomena
of current economic life in the light of the handicraft traditions
and of the preconceptions of natural rights associated
with that system, and still looked to the ideal of
"natural liberty" as the goal of economic development
and the end of economic reform. They were ruled by the
principles (habits of thought) which had arisen out of an
earlier situation, so effectually as not to see that the rule
of equal opportunity which they aimed to establish was
already technologically obsolete.[6]

During the hundred years and more of this ascendancy
of the natural-rights theories in economic science, the
growth of technological knowledge has unremittingly
gone forward, and concomitantly the large-scale industry
has grown great and progressively dominated the field.
This large-scale industrial regime is what the socialists,
and some others, call "capitalism." "Capitalism," as so
used, is not a neat and rigid technical term, but it is
definite enough to be useful for many purposes. On its
technological side the characteristic trait of this capitalism
is that the current pursuit of industry requires a larger
unit of material equipment than one individual can com-*

[Footnote 6: For a more extended discussion of this point see the <i>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, July, 1899, "The Preconceptions of

-----File: 350.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\VerenaM\Cosmas\Hermit00\--------
*pass by his own labor, and larger than one person can
make use of alone.

So soon as the capitalist r√©gime, in this sense, comes in,
it ceases to be true that the owner of the industrial equipment
(or the controller of it) in any given case is or may
be the producer of it, in any na√Øve sense of "production."
He is under the necessity of acquiring its ownership
or control by some other expedient than that of industrially
productive work. The pursuit of industry requires
an accumulation of wealth, and, barring force,
fraud, and inheritance, the method of acquiring such an
accumulation of wealth is necessarily some form of bargaining;
that is to say, some form of business enterprise.
Wealth is accumulated, within the industrial field, from
the gains of business; that is to say, from the gains of
advantageous bargaining.[7] Taking the situation by and
large, looking to the body of business enterprise as a
whole, the advantageous bargaining from which gains
accrue and from which, therefore, accumulations of capital
are derived, is necessarily, in the last analysis, a bargaining
between those who own (or control) industrial
wealth and those whose work turns this wealth to account
in productive industry. This bargaining for hire--commonly
a wage agreement--is conducted under the rule of
free contract, and is concluded according to the play of
demand and supply, as has been well set forth by many
writers.

On this technological view of capital, as here spoken

[Footnote 7: Marx holds that the "primitive accumulation" from which
capitalism takes its rise is a matter of force and fraud (<i>Capital</i>,
Book I, chap. xxiv.). Sombart holds the source to have been
landed wealth (<i>Moderne[** Moderner] Kapitalismus</i>, Book II, Part II,
especially chap. xii). Ehrenberg and other critics of Sombart
incline to the view that the most important source was usury and
the petty trade (<i>Zeitalter der Fugger</i>, chaps. i, ii).]
-----File: 351.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\maggiemeh\aagam\Hermit00\-------
for, the relations between the two parties to the bargain,
the capitalist-employer and the working class, stand as
follows. More or less rigorously, the technological situation
enforces a certain scale and method in the various
lines of industry.[8] The industry can, in effect, be carried
on only by recourse to the technologically requisite scale
and method, and this requires a material equipment of a
certain (large) magnitude; while material equipment of
this required magnitude is held exclusively by the capitalist-employer,
and is <i>de facto</i> beyond the reach of the
common man.

A corresponding body of immaterial equipment--knowledge
and practice of ways and means--is likewise
requisite, under the rule of the same technological exigencies.
This immaterial equipment is in part drawn on in
the making of the material equipment held by the capitalist-employers,
in part in the use to be made of this
material equipment in the further processes of industry.
This body of immaterial equipment so drawn on in any
line of industry is, relatively, still larger, being, on any
exhaustive analysis, virtually the whole body of industrial
experience accumulated by the community up to date. A
free draft on this common stock of technological wisdom
must be had both in the construction and in the subsequent
use of the material equipment; although no one
person can master, or himself employ, more than an
inconsiderable fraction of the immaterial equipment so

[Footnote 8: The phrase "more or less" covers a certain margin of tolerance
in respect of scale and method, which may be very appreciably
wider in some lines of industry than in others, and which
cannot be more adequately defined or described here within such
space as could reasonably be allowed. The requirement of scale
and method is enforced by competition. The force and reach of
this competitive adjustment can also not be dealt with here, but
the familiar current acceptance of the fact will dispense with
details.]
-----File: 352.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-----
drawn on for the installation or operation of any given
block of the material equipment.

The owner of the material equipment, the capitalist-employer,
is, in the typical case, not possessed of any
appreciable fraction of the immaterial equipment necessarily
drawn on in the construction and subsequent use of
the material equipment owned (controlled) by him. His
knowledge and training, so far as it enters into the question,
is a knowledge of business, not of industry.[9] The
slight technological proficiency which he has or needs for
his business ends is of a general character, wholly superficial
and impracticable in point of workmanlike efficiency;
nor is it turned to account in actual workmanship.
He therefore "needs in his business" the service of persons
who have a competent working mastery of this immaterial
technological equipment, and it is with such persons
that his bargains for hire are made. By and large,
the measure of their serviceability for his ends is the
measure of their technological competency. No workman
not possessed of some fractional mastery of the technological
requirements is employed,--imbeciles are useless
in proportion to their imbecility; and even unskilled
and "unintelligent" workmen, so called, are of relatively
little use, although they may be possessed of a proficiency
in the commonplace industrial details such as would bulk
large in absolute magnitude. The "common laborer" is,
in fact, a highly trained and widely proficient workman
when contrasted with the conceivable human blank supposed
to have drawn on the community for nothing but
his physique.

In the hands of these workmen--the industrial community,
the bearers of the immaterial, technological equipment--the
capital goods owned by the capitalist become

[Footnote 9: <i>Cf.</i> <i>Theory of Business Enterprise</i>, chap. iii.]
-----File: 353.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
a "means of production." Without them, or in the hands
of men who do not know their use, the goods in question
would be simply raw materials, somewhat deranged and
impaired through having been given the form which now
makes them "capital goods." The more proficient the
workmen in their mastery of the technological expedients
involved, and the greater the facility with which they are
able to put these expedients into effect, the more productive
will be the processes in which the workmen turn the
employer's capital goods to account. So, also, the more
competent the work of "superintendence," the foreman-like
oversight and correlation of the work in respect of
kind, speed, volume, the more will it count in the aggregate
of productive efficiency. But this work of correlation
is a function of the foreman's mastery of the technological
situation at large and his facility in proportioning
one process of industry to the requirements and effects of
another. Without this due and sagacious correlation of
the processes of industry, and their current adaptation to
the demands of the industrial situation at large, the material
equipment engaged would have but slight efficiency
and would count for but little in the way of capital goods.
The efficiency of the control exercised by the master-workman,
engineer, superintendent, or whatever term
may be used to designate the technological expert who
controls and correlates the productive processes,--this
workmanlike efficiency determines how far the given material
equipment is effectually to be rated as "capital
goods."

Through all this functioning of the workman and the
foreman the capitalist's business ends are ever in the background,
and the degree of success that attends his business
endeavors depends, other things equal, on the efficiency
with which these technologists carry on the proc-*
-----File: 354.png---\Pitirim\sirathiel\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
*esses of industry in which he has invested. His working
arrangements with these workmen, the bearers of the
immaterial equipment engaged, enables the capitalist to
turn the processes for which his capital goods are adapted
to account for his own profit, but at the cost of such a
deduction from the aggregate product of these processes
as the workmen may be able to demand in return for their
work. The amount of this deduction is determined by
the competitive bidding of other capitalists who may have
use for the same lines of technological efficiency, in the
manner set forth by writers on wages.

With the conceivable consolidation of all material
assets under one business management, so as to eliminate
competitive bidding between employers, it is plain that
the resulting business concern would command the undivided
forces of the technological situation, with such deduction
as is involved in the livelihood of the working
population. This livelihood would in such a case be reduced
to the most economical footing, as seen from the
standpoint of the employer. And the employer (capitalist)
would be the <i>de facto</i> owner of the community's
aggregate knowledge of ways and means, except so far as
this body of immaterial equipment serves also the housekeeping
routine of the working population. How nearly
the current economic situation may approach to this finished
state is a matter of opinion. There is also place for
a broad question whether the conditions are more or less
favorable to the working population under the existing
business r√©gime, involving competitive bidding between
the several business concerns, than they would be in case
a comprehensive business consolidation had eliminated
competition and placed the ownership of the material
assets on a footing of unqualified monopoly. Nothing
-----File: 355.png---\Pitirim\sirathiel\maggiemeh\Cosmas\Hermit00\---------
but vague surmises can apparently be offered in answer
to these questions.

But as bearing on the question of monopoly and the
use of the community's immaterial equipment it is to be
kept in mind that the technological situation as it stands
to-day does not admit of a complete monopolisation of
the community's technological expedients, even if a complete
monopolisation of the existing aggregate of material
property were effected. There is still current a large
body of industrial processes to which the large-scale
methods do not apply and which do not presume such a
large unit of material equipment or involve such rigorous
correlation with the large-scale industry as to take them
out of the range of discretionary use by persons not possessed
of appreciable material wealth. Typical of such
lines of work, hitherto not amenable to monopolisation,
are the details of housekeeping routine alluded to above.
It is, in fact, still possible for an appreciable fraction of
the population to "pick up a living," more or less precarious,
without recourse to the large-scale processes that are
controlled by the owners of the material assets. This
somewhat precarious margin of free recourse to the commonplace
knowledge of ways and means appears to be
what stands in the way of a neater adjustment of wages
to the "minimum of subsistence" and the virtual ownership
of the immaterial equipment by the owners of the
material equipment.

It follows from what has been said that all tangible[10]
assets owe their productivity and their value to the immaterial
industrial expedients which they embody or which

[Footnote 10: "Tangible assets" is here taken to signify serviceable capital
goods considered as valuable possessions yielding income to their
owner.]
-----File: 356.png---\Pitirim\sirathiel\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
their ownership enables their owner to engross. These
immaterial industrial expedients are necessarily a product
of the community, the immaterial residue of the community's
experience, past and present; which has no existence
apart from the community's life, and can be transmitted
only in the keeping of the community at large.
It may be objected by those who make much of the productivity
of capital that tangible capital goods on hand
are themselves of value and have a specific productive
efficiency, if not apart from the industrial processes in
which they serve, then at least as a prerequisite to these
processes, and therefore a material condition-precedent
standing in a causal relation to the industrial product.
But these material goods are themselves a product of the
past exercise of technological knowledge, and so back to
the beginning. What there is involved in the material
equipment, which is not of this immaterial, spiritual nature,
and so what is not an immaterial residue of the
community's experience, is the raw material out of which
the industrial appliances are constructed, with the stress
falling wholly on the "raw."

The point is illustrated by what happens to a mechanical
contrivance which goes out of date because of a technological
advance and is displaced by a new contrivance
embodying a new process. Such a contrivance "goes to
the junk-heap," as the phrase has it. The specific technological
expedient which it embodies ceases to be effective
in industry, in competition with "improved methods."
It ceases to be an immaterial asset. When it is in this
way eliminated, the material repository of it ceases to
have value as capital. It ceases to be a material asset.
"The original and indestructible powers" of the material
constituents of capital goods, to adapt Ricardo's
phrase, do not make these constituents capital goods; nor,
-----File: 357.png---\Pitirim\sirathiel\maggiemeh\A. B. Dahl\Hermit00\-----
indeed, do these original and indestructible powers of
themselves bring the objects in question into the category
of economic goods at all. The raw materials--land,
minerals, and the like--may, of course, be valuable
property, and may be counted among the assets of a business.
But the value which they so have is a function of
the anticipated use to which they may be put, and that is
a function of the technological situation under which it is
anticipated that they will be useful.

<tb>

All this may seem to undervalue or perhaps to overlook
the physical facts of industry and the physical nature of
commodities. There is, of course, no call to understate
the importance of material goods or of manual labor.
The goods about which this inquiry turns are the products
of trained labor working on the available materials; but
the labor has to be trained, in the large sense, in order to
be labor, and the materials have to be available in order
to be materials of industry. And both the trained efficiency
of the labor and the availability of the material
objects engaged are a function of the "state of the industrial
arts."

Yet the state of the industrial arts is dependent on the
traits of human nature, physical, intellectual, and spiritual,
and on the character of the material environment.
It is out of these elements that the human technology is
made up; and this technology is efficient only as it meets
with the suitable material conditions and is worked out,
practically, in the material forces required. The brute
forces of the human animal are an indispensable factor in
industry, as are likewise the physical characteristics of
the material objects with which industry deals. And it
seems bootless to ask how much of the products of indus-*
-----File: 358.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-----
*try or of its productivity is to be imputed to these brute
forces, human and non-human, as contrasted with the specifically
human factors that make technological efficiency.
Nor is it necessary to go into questions of that import
here, since the inquiry here turns on the productive relation
of capital to industry; that is to say, the relation of
the material equipment and its ownership to men's dealings
with the physical environment in which the race is
placed. The question of capital goods (including that
of their ownership and therefore including the question of
investment) is a question of how mankind as a species of
intelligent animals deals with the brute forces at its disposal.
It is a question of how the human agent deals
with his means of life, not of how the forces of the
environment deal with man. Questions of the latter class
belong under the head of Ecology, a branch of the biological
sciences dealing with the adaptive variability of
plants and animals. Economic inquiry would belong
under that category if the human response to the forces
of the environment were instinctive and variational only,
including nothing in the way of a technology. But in
that case there would be no question of capital goods, or
of capital, or of labor. Such questions do not arise in
relation to the non-human animals.

In an inquiry into the productivity of labor some perplexity
might be met with as to the share or the place of
the brute forces of the human organism in the theory of
production; but in relation to capital that question does
not arise, except so far as these forces are involved in the
production of the capital goods. As a parenthesis, more
or less germane to the present inquiry into capital, it may
be remarked that an analysis of the productive powers of
labor would apparently take account of the brute energies
-----File: 359.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\Cosmas\Hermit00\-------------
of mankind (nervous and muscular energies) as material
forces placed at the disposal of man by circumstances
largely beyond human control, and in great part not theoretically
dissimilar to the like nervous and muscular
forces afforded by the domestic animals.

ON THE NATURE OF CAPITAL[1]


II. <sc>Investment, Intangible Assets, and the
Pecuniary Magnate</sc>

What has been said in the earlier section of this paper[2]
applies to "capital goods," so called, and it is intended to
apply to these in their character of "productive goods"
rather than in their character of "capital"; that is to say,
what is had in mind is the industrial, or technological,
efficiency and subservience of the material means of production,
rather than the pecuniary use and effect of invested
wealth. The inquiry has dealt with the industrial
equipment as "plant" rather than as "assets." In the
course of this inquiry it has appeared that out of the
profitable engrossing of the community's industrial efficiency
through control of the material equipment there
arises the practice of investment, which has further consequences
that merit more detailed attention.

Investment is a pecuniary transaction, and its aim is
pecuniary gain,--gain in terms of value and ownership.
Invested wealth is capital, a pecuniary magnitude, measured
in terms of value and determined in respect of its
magnitude by a valuation which proceeds on an appraisement
of the gain expected from the ownership of this
invested wealth. In modern business practice, capital is
distinguished into two co√∂rdinate categories of assets,

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly Journal of
Economics</i>, Vol. XXIII, Nov., 1908.]

[Footnote 2: See this Journal for August, 1908.]
-----File: 361.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
tangible and intangible. "Tangible assets" is here taken
to designate pecuniarily serviceable capital goods, considered
as a valuable possession yielding an income to their
owner. Such goods, material items of wealth, are
"assets" to the amount of their capitalisable value, which
may be more or less closely related to their industrial
serviceability as productive goods. "Intangible assets"
are immaterial items of wealth, immaterial facts owned,
valued, and capitalised on an appraisement of the gain to
be derived from their possession. These are also assets
to the amount of their capitalisable value, which has
commonly little, if any, relation to the industrial serviceability
of these items of wealth considered as factors of
production.

<tb>

Before going into the matter of intangible assets, it is
necessary to speak further of the consequences which
investment--and hence capitalisation--has for the use
and serviceability of (material) capital goods. It has
commonly been assumed by economists, without much
scrutiny, that the gains which accrue from invested wealth
are derived from and (roughly) measured by the productivity
of the industrial process in which the items of
wealth so invested are employed, productivity being
counted in some terms of material serviceability to the
community, conduciveness to the livelihood, comfort, or
consumptive needs of the community. In the course of
the present inquiry it has appeared that the gainfulness
of such invested wealth (tangible assets) is due to a more
or less extensive engrossing of the community's industrial
efficiency. The aggregate gains of the aggregate material
capital accrue from the community's industrial activity,
and bear some relation to the productive capacity of the
industrial traffic so engrossed. But it will be noted that
-----File: 362.png---\Pitirim\sirathiel\maggiemeh\Cosmas\Hermit00\---------
there is no warrant in the analysis of these phenomena
as here set forth for alleging that the gains of investment
bear a relation of equality or proportion to the material
serviceability of the capital goods, as rated in terms of
effectual usefulness to the community. Given capital
goods, tangible assets, may owe their pecuniary serviceability
to their owner, and so their value, to other things
than their serviceability to the community; although the
gains of investment in the aggregate are drawn from the
aggregate material productivity of the community's industry.

The ownership of the material equipment gives the
owner not only the right of use over the community's
immaterial equipment, but also the right of abuse and of
neglect or inhibition. This power of inhibition may be
made to afford an income, as well as the power to serve;
and whatever will yield an income may be capitalised
and become an item of wealth to its possessor. Under
modern conditions of investment it happens not infrequently
that it becomes pecuniarily expedient for the
owner of the material equipment to curtail or retard the
processes of industry,--"restraint of trade." The motive
in all such cases of retardation is the pecuniary expediency
of the measure for the owner (controller) of capital,--expediency
in terms of income from investment, not
expediency in terms of serviceability to the community at
large or to any fraction of the community except the
owner (manager). Except for the exigencies of investment,
<i>i.e.</i>, exigencies of pecuniary gain to the investor,
phenomena of this character would have no place in the
industrial system. They invariably come of the endeavors
of business men to secure a pecuniary gain or to avoid
a pecuniary loss. More frequently, perhaps, man[oe]uvers
of inhibition--advised idleness of plant--in industry
-----File: 363.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
aim to effect a saving or avoid a waste than to procure
an increase of gain; but the saving to be effected and the
waste to be avoided are always pecuniary saving to the
owner and pecuniary waste in the matter of ownership,
not a saving of goods to the community or a prevention
of wasteful consumption or wasteful expenditure of effort
and resources on the part of the community. Pecuniary--that
is to say, differential--advantage to the capitalist-manager
has, under the r√©gime of investment, taken precedence
of economic advantage to the community; or rather,
the differential advantage of ownership is alone regarded
in the conduct of industry under this system.

Business practices which inhibit industrial efficiency
and curtail the industrial output are too well known to
need particular enumeration. Nor is it necessary to cite
evidence to show that such inhibition and curtailment are
resorted to from motives of pecuniary expediency. But
an illustrative example or two will make the theoretical
point clearer, and perhaps more plainly bring out the
wholly pecuniary grounds of such business procedure.
The most comprehensive principle involved in this class
of business management is that of raising prices, and so
increasing the net gains of business, by limiting the supply,
or "charging what the traffic will bear." Of a similar
effect, for the point here in question, are the obstructive
tactics designed to hinder the full efficiency of
a business rival. These phenomena lie along the line of
division between tangible and intangible assets. Successful
strategy of this kind may, by force of custom, legislation,
or the "freezing-out" of rival concerns, pass into
settled conditions of differential advantage for the given
business concern, which so may be capitalised as an item
of intangible assets and take their place in the business
community as articles of invested wealth.
-----File: 364.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------

But, aside from such capitalisation of inefficiency, it
is at least an equally consequential fact that the processes
of productive industry are governed in detail by the exigencies
of investment, and therefore by the quest of gain
as counted in terms of price, which leads to the dependence
of production on the course of prices. So that,
under the r√©gime of capital, the community is unable to
turn its knowledge of ways and means to account for a
livelihood except at such seasons and in so far as the
course of prices affords a differential advantage to the
owners of the material equipment. The question of advantageous--which
commonly means rising--prices for
the owners (managers) of the capital goods is made to
decide the question of livelihood for the rest of the community.
The recurrence of hard times, unemployment,
and the rest of that familiar range of phenomena, goes to
show how effectual is the inhibition of industry exercised
by the ownership of capital under the price system.[3]

So also as regards the discretionary abuse of the community's
industrial efficiency vested in the owner of the
material equipment. Disserviceability may be capitalised
as readily as serviceability, and the ownership of the
capital goods affords a discretionary power of misdirecting
the industrial processes and perverting[4] industrial
efficiency, as well as of inhibiting or curtailing industrial
processes and their output, while the outcome may still
be profitable to the owner of the capital goods. There is
a large volume of capital goods whose value lies in their
turning the technological inheritance to the injury of man-*

unemployment, etc., see <i>The Theory of Business Enterprise</i>,
chap. vii (pp. 185-252, especially 196-212).]

[Footnote 4: By "perversion" is here meant such disposition of the industrial
forces as entails a net waste or detriment to the community's
livelihood.]
-----File: 365.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
*kind. Such are, <i>e.g.</i>, naval and military establishments,
together with the docks, arsenals, schools, and manufactories
of arms, ammunition, and naval and military
stores, that supplement and supply such establishments.
These armaments and the like are, of course, public and
quasi-public enterprises, under the current r√©gime, with
somewhat disputable relations to the system of current
business enterprise. But it is no far-fetched interpretation
to say that they are, in great part, a material equipment
for the maintenance of law and order, and so enable
the owners of capital goods with immunity to inhibit or
pervert the industrial processes when the exigencies of
business profits make it expedient; that they are, further,
a means--more or less ineffectual, it is true--for extending
and protecting trade, and so serve the differential
advantage of business men at the cost of the community;
and that they are also in large part a material equipment
set apart for the diversion of a livelihood from the community
at large to the military, naval, diplomatic, and
other official classes. These establishments may in any
case be taken as illustrating how items of material equipment
may be devoted to and may be valued for the use of
the technological expedients for the damage and discomfort
of mankind, without sensible offset or abatement.

Typical of a class of investments which derive profits
from capital goods devoted to uses that are altogether
dubious, with a large presumption of net detriment, are
such establishments as race-tracks, saloons, gambling-houses,
and houses of prostitution.[5] Some spokesmen of

[Footnote 5: Should the connection at this point with the main argument
of the paper as set forth in the earlier section seem doubtful or
obscure, it may be called to mind that these dubious enterprises in
dissipation are cases of investment for a profit, and that the
"capital goods" engaged are invested wealth yielding an income,
but that they yield an income only on the fulfillment of two]*
-----File: 366.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
the "non-Christian tribes" might wish to include churches
under the same category, but the consensus of opinion in
modern communities inclines to look on churches as serviceable,
on the whole; and it may be as well not to attempt
to assign them a specific place in the scheme of
serviceable and disserviceable use of invested wealth.

There is, further, a large field of business, employing
much capital goods and many technological processes,
whose profits come from products in which serviceability
and disserviceability are mingled with waste in the most
varying proportions. Such are the production of goods
of fashion, disingenuous proprietary articles, sophisticated
household supplies, newspapers and advertising enterprise.
In the degree in which business of this class draws
its profits from wasteful practices, spurious goods, illusions
and delusions, skilled mendacity, and the like, the
capital goods engaged must be said to owe their capitalisable
value to a perverse use of the technological expedients
employed.

These wasteful or disserviceable uses of capital goods
have been cited, not as implying that the technological
proficiency embodied in these goods or brought into ef-*

*[Footnote: conditions: (<i>a</i>) the possession and employment of these capital
goods enables their holder to turn to account the common stock
of technological proficiency, in those bearings in which it may be
of use in his enterprise; and (<i>b</i>) the limited amount of wealth
available for the purpose enables their holder to "engross" the
usufruct of such a fraction of the common stock of technological
proficiency, in the degree determined by this limitation of the
amount available. In so far, these enterprises are like any
other industrial enterprise; but beyond this they have the
peculiarity that they do not, or need not, even ostensibly, turn the
current knowledge and use of ways and means to "productive"
account for the community at large, but simply take their stand
on the (institutionally sacred) "accomplished fact" of invested
wealth. They have less of the fog of apology about them than
the common run of business enterprise.]
-----File: 367.png---\skywrite\sirathiel\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
*fect in their use, intrinsically has a disserviceable bearing,
nor that investment in these things, and business enterprise
in the management of them, need aim at disserviceability,
but only to bring out certain minor points
of theory, obvious but commonly overlooked: (<i>a</i>) technological
proficiency is not of itself and intrinsically serviceable
or disserviceable to mankind,--it is only a means
of efficiency for good or ill; (<i>b</i>) the enterprising use of
capital goods by their businesslike owner aims not at
serviceability to the community, but only at serviceability
to the owner; (<i>c</i>) under the price system--under the rule
of pecuniary standards and management--circumstances
make it advisable for the business man at times to mismanage
the processes of industry, in the sense that it is
expedient for his pecuniary gain to inhibit, curtail, or misdirect
industry, and so turn the community's technological
proficiency to the community's detriment. These somewhat
commonplace points of theory are of no great weight
in themselves, but they are of consequence for any theory
of business or of life under the rules of the price system,
and they have an immediate bearing here on the question
of intangible assets.

<tb>

At the risk of some tedium it is necessary to the theory
of intangible assets to pursue this analysis and piecing
together of commonplaces somewhat farther. As has
already been remarked, "assets" is a pecuniary concept,
not a technological one; a concept of business, not of industry.
Assets are capital, and tangible assets are items
of material equipment and the like, considered as available
for capitalisation. The tangibility of tangible assets
is a matter of the materiality of the items of wealth of
which they are made up, while they are assets to the
amount of their value. Capital goods, which typically
-----File: 368.png---\hsnitch\Mosom\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
make up the category of tangible assets, are capital goods
by virtue of their technological serviceability, but they
are capital in the measure, not of their technological serviceability,
but in the measure of the income which they
may yield to their owner. The like is, of course, true of
intangible assets, which are likewise capital, or assets, in
the measure of their income-yielding capacity. Their
intangibility is a matter of the immateriality of the items
of wealth--objects of ownership--of which they are
made up, but their character and magnitude as assets is
a matter of the gainfulness to their owner of the processes
which their ownership enables him to engross. The facts
so engrossed, in the case of intangible assets, are not of a
technological or industrial character; and herein lies the
substantial disparity between tangible and intangible assets.

Mankind has other dealings with the material means of
life, besides those covered by the community's technological
proficiency. These other dealings have to do with
the use, distribution, and consumption of the goods procured
by the employment of the community's technological
proficiency, and are carried out under working arrangements
of an institutional character,--use and wont, law
and custom. The principles and practice of the distribution
of wealth vary with the changes in technology and
with the other cultural changes that are going forward;
but it is probably safe to assume that the principles of
apportionment,--that is to say, the consensus of habitual
opinion as to what is right and good in the distribution of
the product,--these principles and the concomitant methods
of carrying them out in practice have always been
such as to give one person or group or class something
of a settled preference above another. Something of
this kind, something in the way of a conventionally ar-*
-----File: 369.png---\Emeraldblue\sirathiel\maggiemeh\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*ranged differential advantage in the apportionment of the
common livelihood, is to be found in all cultures and communities
that have been observed at all carefully; and
it is perhaps needless to remark that in the higher cultures
such economic preferences, privileges, prerogatives,
differential advantages and disadvantages, are numerous
and varied, and that they make up an intricate fabric of
economic institutions. Indeed, peculiarities of class difference
in some such respect are among the most striking
and decisive features that distinguish one cultural era
from another. In all phases of material civilisation these
preferential advantages are sought and valued. Classes
or groups which are in a position to make good a claim
to such differential advantages commonly come, in due
course, to put forward such claims; as, <i>e.g.</i>, the priesthood,
the princely and ruling class, the men as contrasted
with the women, the adults as against minors, the able-bodied
as against the infirm. Principles (habits of
thought) countenancing some form of class or personal
preference in the distribution of income are to be found
incorporated in the moral code of all known civilisations
and embodied in some form of institution. Such items
of immaterial wealth are of a differential character, in
that the advantage of those who secure the preference is
the disadvantage of those who do not; and it may be mentioned
in passing, that such a differential advantage inuring
to any one class or person commonly carries a more
than equal disadvantage to some other class or person or
to the community at large.[6]

[Footnote 6: This statement may not seem clear without indicating in a
more concrete manner some terms in which to measure the relative
differential advantage and disadvantage which so emerge in
such a case of prerogative or privilege. Where, as in the earlier,
non-pecuniary phases of culture, no price test is applicable, the
statement in the text may be taken to mean that the differential]*
-----File: 370.png---\skywrite\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------

When property rights fall into definite shape and the
price system comes in, and more particularly when the
practice of investment arises and business enterprise
comes into vogue, such differential advantages take on
something of the character of intangible assets. They
come to have a pecuniary value and rating, whether they
are transferable or not; and if they are transferable, if
they can be sold and delivered, they become assets in a
fairly clear and full sense of that term. Such immaterial
wealth, preferential benefits of the nature of intangible
assets, may be a matter of usage simply, as the vogue
of a given public house, or of a given tradesman, or of a
given brand of consumable goods; or may be a matter
of arrogation, as the King's Customs in early times, or
the once notorious Sound Dues, or the closing of public
highways by large land-owners; or of contractual concession,
as the freedom of a city or a guild, or a franchise in
the Hanseatic League or in the Associated Press; or of
government concession, whether on the basis of a bargain
or otherwise, as the many trade monopolies of early
modern times, or a corporation charter, or a railway franchise,
or letters of marque, or letters patent; or of statutory
creation, as trade protection by import, export, or
excise duties or navigation laws; or of conventionalised
superstitious punctilio, as the creation of a demand for
wax by the devoutly obligatory consumption of consecrated
tapers, or the similar devout consumption of and
demand for fish during Lent.

Under the r√©gime of investment and business enterprise
these and the like differential benefits may turn to
the business advantage of a given class, group, or con-*

*[Footnote: disadvantage at the cost of which the differential benefit in question
is gained is greater than the beneficiary would be willing to
undergo in order to procure this benefit.]
-----File: 371.png---\skywrite\sirathiel\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
*cern, and in such an event the resulting differential business
advantage in the pursuit of gain becomes an asset,
capitalised on the basis of its income-yielding capacity,
and possibly vendible under the cover of a corporation
security (as, <i>e.g.</i>, common stock), or even under the usual
form of private sale (as, <i>e.g.</i>, the appraised good-will of
a business concern).

But the r√©gime of business enterprise has not only taken
over various forms of institutional privileges and prerogatives
out of the past: it also gives rise to new kinds of
differential advantage and capitalises them into intangible
assets. These are all (or virtually all) of one kind,
in that their common aim and common basis of value
and capitalisation is a preferentially advantageous sale.
Naturally so, since the end of all business endeavor, in
the last analysis, is an advantageous sale. The commonest
and typical kind of such intangible assets is "good-will[** inserted hyphen to match final 'good-will' on page],"
so called,--a term which has come to cover a great
variety of differential business advantages, but which in
the original business usage of it meant the customary resort
of a client√®le to the concern so possessed of the good-will.
It seems originally to have implied a kindly sentiment
of trust and esteem on the part of a customer, but
as the term is now used it has lost this sentimental content.
In the broad and loose sense in which it is now
currently employed it is extended to cover such special
advantages as inure to a monopoly or a combination of
business concerns through its power to limit or engross
the supply of a given line of goods or services. So long
as such a special advantage is not specifically protected
by special legislation or by a due legal instrument,--as
in the case of a franchise or a patent right,--it is likely
to be spoken of loosely as "good-will."

The results of the analysis may be summed up to show
-----File: 372.png---\skywrite\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------------
the degree of coincidence and the distinctions between
the two categories of assets: (<i>a</i>) the value (that is to say,
the amount) of given assets, whether tangible or intangible,
is the capitalised (or capitalisable) value of the
given articles of wealth, rated on the basis of their income-yielding
capacity to their owner; (<i>b</i>) in the case of tangible
assets there is a presumption that the objects of
wealth involved have some (at least potential) serviceability
at large, since they serve a materially productive
work, and there is therefore a presumption, more or less
well founded, that their value represents, though it by no
means measures, an item of serviceability at large; (<i>c</i>)
in the case of intangible assets there is no presumption that
the objects of wealth involved have any serviceability at
large, since they serve no materially productive work,
but only a differential advantage to the owner in the distribution
of the industrial product;[7] (<i>d</i>) given tangible

[Footnote 7: A doubt has been offered as to the applicability of this characterization
to such intangible assets as a patent right and other
items of the same class. The doubt seems to arise from a misapprehension
of the analysis and of its intention. It should be
remarked that there is no intention to condemn or disapprove
any of the items here spoken of as intangible assets. The
patent right may be justifiable or it may not: there is no call to
discuss that question here. Other intangible assets are in the
same case in this respect.

Further, as to the character of a patent right considered as an
asset. The invention or innovation covered by the patent right is
a contribution to the common stock of technological proficiency.
It may be (immediately) serviceable to the community at large, or
it may not;--<i>e.g.</i>, a cash register, a bank-check punch, a streetcar
fare register; a burglar-proof safe, and the like are of no
immediate service to the community at large, but serve only a
pecuniary use to their users. But, whether the innovation is useful
or not, the patent right, as an asset, has no (immediate) usefulness
at large, since its essence is the restriction of the usufruct
of the innovation to the patentee. Immediately and directly the
patent right must be considered a detriment to the community at
large, since its purport is to prevent the community from making]*
-----File: 373.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
assets may be disserviceable to the community,--a given
material equipment may owe its value as capital to a disserviceable
use, though in the aggregate or on an average
the body of tangible assets are (presumptively) serviceable;
(<i>e</i>) given intangible assets may be indifferent in respect
of serviceability at large, though in the aggregate,
or on an average, intangible assets are (presumably) disserviceable
to the community.

On this showing it would appear that the substantial
difference between tangible and intangible assets lies in
the different character of the immaterial facts which are
turned to pecuniary account in the one case and in the
other. The former, in effect, capitalise such fraction of
the technological proficiency of the community as the
ownership of the capital goods involved enables the owner
to engross. The latter capitalise such habits of life, of a
non-technological character,--settled by usage, convention,
arrogation, legislative action, or what not,--as will
effect a differential advantage to the concern to which
the assets in question appertain. The former owe their
existence and magnitude to the usufruct of technological
expedients involved in the industrial process proper;
while the latter are in like manner due to the usufruct
of what may be called the interstitial correlations and adjustments
both within the industrial system and between
industry proper and the market, in so far as these relations
are of a pecuniary rather than a technological character.
Much the same distinction may be put in other
words, so as to bring the expression nearer the current
popular apprehension of the matter, by saying that tangible
assets, commonly so called, capitalise the processes
of production, while intangible assets, so called, capitalise

*[Footnote: use of the patented innovation, whatever may be its ulterior beneficial
effects or its ethical justification.]
-----File: 374.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
certain expedients and processes of acquisition, not productive
of wealth, but affecting only its distribution.
Formulated in either way, the distinction seems not to
be an altogether hard-and-fast one, as will immediately
appear if it is called to mind that intangible assets may be
converted into tangible assets, and conversely, as the
exigencies of business may decide. Yet, while the two
categories of assets stand in such close relation to one
another as this state of things presumes, it is still evident
from the same state of things that they are not to be confounded
with one another.

Taking "good-will" as typical of the category of "intangible
assets," as being the most widely prevalent and
at the same time the farthest removed in its characteristics
from the range of "tangible assets," some slight further
discussion of it may serve to bring out the difference
between the two categories of assets and at the same
time to enforce their essential congruity as assets as well
as the substantial connection between them. In the
earlier days of the concept, in the period of growth to
which it owes its name, when good-will was coming into
recognition as a factor affecting assets, it was apparently
looked on habitually as an adventitious differential advantage
accruing spontaneously to the business concern
to which it appertained; an immaterial by-product of the
concern's conduct of business,--commonly presumed to
be an adventitious blessing incident to an upright and
humane course of business life. Poor Richard would
express this sense of the matter in the saying that "honesty
is the best policy." But presently, no doubt, some
thought would be taken of the acquirement of good-will,
and some effort would be expended by the wise business
man in that behalf. Goods would be given a more elegant
finish for the sake of a readier sale, beyond what
-----File: 375.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
would conduce to their brute serviceability simply;
smooth-spoken and obsequious salesmen and solicitors,
gifted with a tactful effrontery, have come to be preferred
to others, who, without these merits, may be possessed
of all the diligence, dexterity, and muscular force
required in their trade; something is expended on convincing,
not to say vain-glorious, show-windows that shall
promise something more than one would like to commit
one's self to in words; itinerant agents, and the like, are
employed at some expense to secure a client√®le; much
thought and substance is spent on advertising of many
kinds.

This last-named item may be taken as typical of the
present stage of growth in the production or generation
of good-will, and therefore in the creation of intangible
assets. Advertising has come to be an important branch
of business enterprise by itself, and it employs a large
and varied array of material appliances and processes
(tangible assets). Investment is made in certain material
items (productive goods), such as printed matter, billboards,
and the like, with a view to creating a certain
body of good-will. The precise magnitude of the product
may not be foreseen, but, if sagaciously made, such investment
rarely fails of the effect aimed at--unless a
business rival with even greater sagacity should out-man[oe]uver
and offset these endeavors with a superior
array of appliances (productive goods) and workmen for
the generation of good-will. The product aimed at, commonly
with effect, is good-will,--an intangible asset,--which
may be considered to have been generated by converting
certain tangible assets into this intangible; or it
may be considered as an industrial product, the output of
certain industrial processes in which the given items of
material equipment are employed and give effect to the
-----File: 376.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
requisite technological proficiency. Whichever view be
taken of the causal relation between the material equipment
and processes employed, on the one hand, and the
output of good-will, on the other hand, the result is substantially
the same for the purpose in hand.

The ulterior end of the advertising is, it may be said,
the sale of an increased quantity of the advertised articles,
at an increased net gain; which would mean an increased
value of the material items offered for sale; which, in
turn, is the same as saying an increase of tangible assets.
It may be assumed without debate that the end of business
endeavor is a gain in final terms of tangible values.
But this ulterior end is, in the case of advertising enterprise,
to be gained only by the intermediate step of a
production of an immaterial item of good-will, an intangible
asset.

So the case in illustration shows not only the conversion
of tangible assets (material capital goods, such as
printed matter) into intangible wealth, or, if that formula
be preferred, the production of immaterial wealth by the
productive use of material wealth, but also, conversely,
in the second step of the process, it shows the conversion
of intangible assets into tangible wealth (enhanced value
of vendible goods), or, if the expression seems preferable,
the production of tangible assets by the use of intangible
wealth.

This creation of tangible wealth out of intangible assets
is seen perhaps at its neatest in the enhancement of land
values by the endeavors of interested parties. Real estate
is, of course, a tangible asset of the most authentic tangibility,
and it is an asset to the amount of its value, which
is determined, say, by the figures at which the real estate
in question is currently bought and sold. This is the
current value of the real estate, and therefore its current
-----File: 377.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
actual magnitude as a tangible asset. The value of the
real estate might also be computed by capitalising its
rental value; but, where the current market value does
not coincide with the capitalised rental value, the former
must, according to business conceptions, be accepted as
the actual value. In many parts of this country, perhaps
in most, but particularly in the Western States and in the
neighborhood of flourishing towns, these two methods of
rating the pecuniary magnitude of real estate will habitually
not coincide. Due allowance, often very considerable,
being made, the capitalised rental value of the land
may be taken as measuring its current serviceability as
an item of material equipment; while the amount by
which the market value of the land exceeds its capitalised
rental value may be taken as the product, the tangible
residue, of an intangible asset of the nature of good-will,
turned to account, or "productively employed," in behalf
of this parcel of land.[8]

Some of the lands of California may be taken as a very
good, though perhaps not an extreme, example of such a
creation of real estate by spiritual instrumentalities. It
is probably well within the mark to say that some of these
lands owe not more than one-half their current market
value to their current serviceability as an instrument of
production or use. The excess may be attributable to
illusions touching the chances of future sale, to anticipation
of a prospective enhanced usefulness, and the like;

[Footnote 8: Neither as a physical magnitude ("land") nor as a pecuniary
magnitude ("real estate") is the capitalised land in question an
item of "good-will"; but its value as real estate--<i>i.e.</i>, its magnitude
as an asset--is in part a product of the "good-will"
(illusions and the like) worked up in its behalf and turned to
account, by the land agent. The real estate is a tangible asset, an
item of material wealth, while the "good-will" to which in part
it owes its magnitude as an item of wealth is an intangible
asset, an item of immaterial wealth.]
-----File: 378.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
but all these are immaterial factors, of the nature of goodwill.
Like other assets, these lands are capitalised on the
basis of the anticipated income from them, part of which
income is anticipated from profitable sales to persons who,
it is hoped, will be persuaded to take a very sanguine view
of the land situation, while part of it may be due to over-sanguine
anticipations of usefulness generated by the advertising
matter and the efforts of the land agents directed
to what is called "developing the country."

To any one preoccupied with the conceit that "capital"
means "capital goods" such a conversion of intangible
into tangible goods, or such a generation of intangible assets
by the productive use of tangible assets, might be
something of a puzzle. If "assets" were a physical concept,
covering a range of physical things, instead of a
pecuniary concept, such conversion of tangible into intangible
assets, and conversely, would be a case of transubstantiation.
But there is nothing miraculous in the
matter. "Assets" are a pecuniary magnitude, and belong
among the facts of investment. Except in relation
to investment the items of wealth involved are not assets.
In other words, assets are a matter of capitalisation,
which is a special case of valuation; and the question of
tangibility or intangibility as regards a given parcel of
assets is a question of what article or class of articles
the valuation shall attach to or be imputed to. If, <i>e.g.</i>,
the fact to which value is imputed in the valuation is the
habitual demand for a given article of merchandise, or
the habitual resort of a given group of customers to a
particular shop or merchant, or a monopolistic control or
limitation of price and supply, then the resulting item of
assets will be "intangible," since the object to which the
capitalised value in question is imputed is an immaterial
object. If the fact which is by imputation made the
-----File: 379.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
bearer of the capitalised value is a material object, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
the merchantable goods of which the supply is arbitrarily
limited or the price arbitrarily fixed, or if it is the material
means of supplying such goods, then the capitalised value
in question is a case of tangible assets. The value involved
is, like all value, a matter of imputation, and as
assets it is a matter of capitalisation; but capitalisation
is an appraisement of a pecuniary "income-stream " in
terms of the vendible objects to the ownership of which
the income is assumed to inure. To what object the capitalised
value of the "income-stream " shall be imputed
is a question of what object of ownership secures to the
owner an effectual claim on this "income-stream "; that
is to say, it is a question of what object of ownership the
strategic advantages is assumed to attach to, which is a
question of the play of business exigencies in the given
case.

The "income-stream" in question is a pecuniary income-stream,
and is in the last resort traceable to transactions
of sale. Within the confines of business--and
therefore within the scope of capital, investments, assets,
and the like business concepts--transactions of purchase
and sale are the final terms of any analysis. But beyond
these confines, comprehending and conditioning the business
system, lie the material facts of the community's
work and livelihood. In the final transaction of sale the
merchantable goods are valued by the consumer, not as
assets, but as livelihood;[9] and in the last analysis and
long run it is to some such transaction that all business
imputations of value and capitalistic appraisement of

[Footnote 9: "Livelihood" is, of course, here taken in a loose sense, not as
denoting the means of subsistence simply or even the means of
physical comfort, but as signifying that the purchases in question
are made with a view to the consumptive use of the goods rather
than with a view to their use for a profit.]
-----File: 380.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
assets must have regard and by which they must finally
be checked. Dissociated from the facts of work and
livelihood, therefore, assets cease to be assets; but this
does not preclude their relation to these facts of work
and livelihood being at times somewhat remote and loose.

Without recourse, immediately or remotely, to certain
material facts of industrial process and equipment, assets
would not yield earnings; that is to say, wholly disjoined
from these material facts, they would in effect not be
assets. This is true for both tangible and intangible assets,
although the relation of the assets to the material
facts of industry is not the same in the two cases. The
case of tangible assets needs no argument. Intangible
assets, such as patent right or monopolistic control, are
likewise of no effect except in effectual contact with industrial
facts. The patent right becomes effective for
the purpose only in the material working of the innovation
covered by it; and monopolistic control is a source
of gain only in so far as it effectually modifies or divides
the supply of goods.

In the light of these considerations it seems feasible to
indicate both the congruence and the distinction between
the two categories of assets a little more narrowly than
was done above. Both are assets,--that is to say, both
are values determined by a capitalisation of anticipated
income-yielding capacity; both depend for their income-yielding
capacity on the preferential use of certain immaterial
factors; both depend for their efficiency on the
use of certain material objects; both may increase or decrease,
as assets, apart from any increase or decrease of
the material objects involved. The tangible assets capitalise
the preferential use of technological, industrial expedients,--expedients
of production, dealing with the
facts of brute nature under the laws of physical cause and
-----File: 381.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
effect,--this preferential use being secured by the ownership
of material articles employed in the processes in
which these expedients are put into effect. The intangible
assets capitalise the preferential use of certain facts
of human nature--habits, propensities, beliefs, aspirations,
necessities--to be dealt with under the psychological
laws of human motivation; this preferential use being
secured by custom, as in the case of old-fashioned
good-will, by legal assignment, as in patent or copyright,
by ownership of the instruments of production, as in the
case of industrial monopolies.[10]

<tb>

Intangible assets are capital as well as tangible assets;
that is to say, they are items of capitalised wealth. Both
categories of assets, therefore, represent expected "income-streams"
which are of such definite character as to
admit of their being rated in set terms per cent. per time
unit; although the expected income need not therefore be
anticipated to come in an even flow or to be distributed
in any equable manner over a period of time. The income-streams
to be so rated and capitalised are associated
in such a manner with some external fact (impersonal to
their claimant), whether material or immaterial, as to
permit their being traced or attributed to an income-yielding
capacity on the part of this external fact, to which
their valuation as a whole may be imputed and which
may then be capitalised as an item of wealth yielding
this income-stream. Income-streams which do not meet

[Footnote 10: The instruments of production so monopolised are, of course,
tangible assets, but the ownership of such means of production in
amount sufficient to enable the owner to monopolise or control
the market, whether for purchase (as of materials or labor) or
for sale (as of marketable goods or services), gives rise to a
differential business advantage which is to be classed as intangible
assets.]
-----File: 382.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
these requirements do not give rise to assets in the accepted
sense of the term, and so do not swell the volume
of capitalised wealth.

There are income-streams which do not meet the necessary
specifications of capitalisable wealth; and in modern
business traffic, particularly, there are large and secure
sources of income that are in this way not capitalisable
and yet yield a legitimate business income. Such are,
indeed, to be rated among the most consequential factors
in the current business situation. Under the guidance
of traditions carried over from a more primitive business
situation, it has been usual to speak of income-streams
derived in such a manner as "wages of superintendence,"
or "undertaker's wages," or "entrepreneur's profits," or,
latterly, as "profits" simply and specifically. Such
phenomena of this class as are of consequence in business
are commonly accounted for, theoretically, under this
head; and the effort so to account for them is to be taken
as, at least, a laudable endeavor to avoid an undue multiplication
of technical terms and categories.[11] Yet the
most striking phenomena of this class, and the most consequential
for modern business and industry, both in
respect of their magnitude and in respect of the pecuniary
dominion and discretion which they represent, cannot
well be accounted undertaker's gains, in the ordinary
sense of that term. The great gains of the great industrial
financiers or of the great "interests," <i>e.g.</i>, do not
answer the description of undertaker's gains, in that they
do not accrue to the captain of industry on the basis of

[Footnote 11: One writer even goes so far in the endeavor to bring the
facts within the scope of the staple concepts of theory at this
point as to rate the persons concerned in such a case as "capital,"
after having satisfied himself that such income-streams are
traceable to a personal source.--See Fisher, <i>Nature of Capital
and Income</i>, chap. v.]
-----File: 383.png---\eyeread\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
his "managerial ability" alone, apart from his wealth
or out of relation to his wealth; and yet it is not safe to
say that such gains (which are over and above ordinary
returns on his investments) accrue on the ground of the
requisite amount of wealth alone, apart from the exercise
of a large business direction on the part of the owner of
such wealth, or on the part of his agent to whom discretion
has been delegated. Administrative, or strategic, discretion
and activity must necessarily be present in the
case: otherwise, the income in question would rightly be
rated as income from capital simply.

The captain of industry, the pecuniary magnate, is normally
in receipt of income in excess of the ordinary rate
per cent. on investment; but apart from his large holdings
he is not in a position to get these large gains.
Dissociated from his large holdings, he is not a large captain
of industry; but it is not the size of his holdings alone
that determines what the gains of the pecuniary magnate
in modern industry shall be. Gains of the kind and magnitude
that currently come to this class of business men
come only on condition that the owner (or his agent)
shall exercise a similarly large discretion and control in
the affairs of the business community; but the magnitude
of the gains, as well as of the discretion and control exercised,
is somewhat definitely conditioned by the magnitude
of the wealth which gives effect to this discretion.

The disposition of pecuniary forces in such matters
may be well seen in the work and remuneration of any
coalition of "interests," such as the modern business community
has become familiar with. The "interests" in
such a case are of a personal character,--they are "interested
parties,"--and the sagacity, experience, and animus
of these various interested parties counts in the outcome,
both as regards the aggregate gains of the coalition and
-----File: 384.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
as regards the distribution of these gains among the several
parties in interest; but the weight of any given "interest"
in a coalition or "system" is more nearly proportioned
to the wealth controlled by the given "interest,"
and to the strategic position of such wealth, than to
any personal talents or proficiency of the "interested
party." The talents and proficiency involved are not the
main facts. Indeed, the movements of such a "system,"
and of the several component "interests," are largely a
matter of artless routine, in which the greatest ingenuity
and initiative engaged in the premises are commonly exercised
by the legal counsel working for a fee.

A dispassionate student of the current business traffic,
who is not overawed by round numbers, will be more impressed
by the ease and simplicity of the man≈ìuvers
that lead to large pecuniary results in the higher business
finance than by any evidence of pre√´minent sagacity and
initiative among the pecuniary magnates. One need only
call to mind the simple and obvious way in which the
promoters of the Steel Corporation were magnificently
checkmated by the financiers of the Carnegie "interest,"
when that great and reluctant corporation was floated,
or the pettyfogging tactics of Standard Oil in its later
career. In extenuation of their visible lack of initiative
and insight it may not be ungraceful to call to mind that
many of the discretionary heads of the great "interests"
are men of advanced years, and that in the nature of the
case the pecuniary magnates of the present generation
must commonly be men of a somewhat advanced age;
and it is only during the present generation that the existing
situation has arisen, with its characteristic opportunities
and demands. To take their present foremost rank
in the new business finance which is here under inquiry,
they have had to accumulate the great wealth on which
-----File: 385.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
alone their discretionary control of business affairs rests,
and their best vigor has been spent in this work of preparation;
so that they have commonly attained the requisite
strategic position only after they had outlived their "years
of discretion."

But there is no intention here to depreciate the work of
the pecuniary magnates or the spokesmen of the great
"interests." The matter has been referred to only as it
bears on this category of capitalistic income which accrues
on other grounds than the "earning-capacity" of
the assets involved, and which still cannot be imputed
to the "earning-capacity" of these business men apart
from these assets. The case is evidently not one of
"wages of superintendence" or "undertaker's profits";
but it is as evidently not a case of the earning-capacity
of the assets. The proof of the latter point is quite as
easy as of the former. If the gains of the "system" or
of its constituent "interests" and magnates were imputable
to the earning-capacity of the assets involved,--in
any accepted sense of "earnings,"--then it would immediately
follow that these assets would be recapitalised on
the basis of these extraordinary earnings, and that the
income derived in this class of traffic should reappear as
interest or dividends on the capital so increased to correspond
with the increased earnings. But such recapitalisation
takes place only to a relatively very limited extent,
and the question then bears on the income which is
not so accounted for in the recapitalisation.

The gains of this class of traffic are, of course, themselves
capitalised,--for the most part they accrue in the
capitalised form, as issues of securities and the like; but
the sources of this income are not capitalised as such.
The (large) accumulated wealth, or assets, which gives
weight to the movements of the "interests" and magnates
-----File: 386.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
in question, and which affords the ground for the discretionary
control of business affairs exercised by them, are,
for the most part at least, invested in ordinary business
ventures, in the form of corporation securities and the
like, and are there earning dividends or interest at current
rates; and these assets are valued in the market (and
thereby capitalised) on the basis of their current earnings
in the various enterprises in which they are so invested.
But their being so invested in profitable business
enterprises does not in the least hinder their usefulness
in the hands of the magnates as a basis or means of carrying
on the large and highly profitable transactions of the
higher industrial finance. To impute these gains to these
assets as "earnings," therefore, would be to count the
assets twice as capital, or rather to count them over and
over.

An additional perplexity in endeavoring to handle gains
of this class theoretically as earnings, in the ordinary
sense, arises from the fact that they stand in no definable
time relation to their underlying assets. They have
no definable "time-shape," as Mr. Fisher might put it.[12]
Such gains are timeless, in the sense that the time relation
does not count in any substantial manner or in any sensible
degree in their determination.[13]

<tb>

In a more painstaking statement of this point of theory
it would be necessary to note that these gains are "timeless,"
in the sense indicated, in so far as the enterprise
from which they accrue is dissociated from the technological
circumstances and processes of industry, and only in

[Footnote 12: <i>Cf.</i> Fisher, <i>Rate of Interest</i>, chap. vi.]

[Footnote 13: This conclusion is reached, <i>e.g.</i>, by Mr. G. P. Watkins (<i>The
Growth of Large Fortunes</i>, chap. iii, sec. 10), although
through a curious etymological misapprehension he rejects the
term "timeless" as not available.]
-----File: 387.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
so far. Technological (industrial) procedure, being of
the nature of physical causation, is subject to the time
relation under which causal sequence runs. This is the
basis of such discussions of capital and interest as those
of B√∂hm-Bawerk, and of Fisher. But business traffic,
as distinguished from the processes of industry, being
not immediately concerned with the technological process,
is also not immediately or uniformly subject to the time
relation involved in the causal sequence of the technological
process. Business traffic is subject to the time relation
because and in so far as it depends upon and follows
up the processes of production. The commonplace
or old-fashioned business enterprise, the competitive system
of investment in industrial business simply, commonly
rests pretty directly on the due sequence of the
industrial processes in which the investments of such
enterprise are placed. Such enterprise, as conceived by
the current theories of capital, does business at first hand
in the industrial efficiency of the community, which is
conditioned by the time relation of the causal sequence,
and which is, indeed, in great measure a function of the
time consumed in the technological processes. Therefore,
the gains, as well as the transactions, of such enterprise
are also commonly somewhat closely conditioned by
the like time relation, and they typically emerge under
the form of a per-cent. per time unit; that is to say, as a
function of the lapse of time. Yet the business transactions
themselves are not a matter of the lapse of time.
Time is not of the essence of the case. The magnitude
of a pecuniary transaction is not a function of the time
consumed in concluding it, nor are the gains which accrue
from the transaction. In business enterprise on the
higher plane, which is here under inquiry, the relation of
the transactions, and of their gains, to the consecution
-----File: 388.png---\Pitirim\CharlesH\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
of the technological processes remotely underlying them
is distant, loose, and uncertain, so that the time element
here does not obtrude itself: rather, it somewhat obviously
falls into abeyance, marking the degree of its remoteness.
Yet this phase of business enterprise, like any other, of
course takes place in time; and, it is also to be remarked,
the volume of the traffic and the gains derived from it are,
no doubt, somewhat closely conditioned in the long run
by the time relation which dominates that technological
(industrial) efficiency on which this enterprise, too, ultimately
and indirectly rests and from which in the last
resort its gains are finally drawn, however remotely and
indirectly.

An analysis of these phenomena on lines similar to
those which have been followed in the discussion of assets
above is not without difficulty, nor can it fairly be
expected to yield any but tentative and provisional results.
The matter has received so little attention from
economic theoreticians that even significant mistakes in
this connection are of very rare occurrence.[14] The cause
of this scant attention to these matters lies, no doubt, in
the relative novelty of the facts in question. The facts
may be roughly drawn together under the caption "Traffic
in Vendible Capital"; although that term serves rather
as a comprehensive designation of the class of business
enterprise from which these gains accrue than as an
adequate chararacterisation[**typo for characterisation?] of the play of forces involved.[15]
Traffic in vendible capital has not been un-*

[Footnote 14: Even Mr. Watkins (as cited above), <i>e.g.</i>, is led by a superficial
generalisation to class these gains as "speculative," and so
to excuse himself from a closer acquaintance with their character
and with the bearings of the class of business enterprise out
of which they arise.]

*known in the past, but it is only recently that it has come
into the foreground as the most important line of business
enterprise. Such it now is, in that it is in this traffic
that the ultimate initiative and discretion in business are
now to be found. It is at the same time the most gainful
of business enterprise, not only in absolute terms, but
relatively to the magnitude of the assets involved as well.
One reason for this superior gainfulness is the fact that
the assets involved in this traffic are at the same time
engaged as assets to their full extent in ordinary business,
so that the peculiar gains of this traffic are of the
nature of a bonus above the earnings of the invested
wealth. "It is like finding money."

As was said above, the method, or the ways and means,
characteristic of this superior business enterprise is a
traffic in vendible capital. The wealth gained in this
field is commonly in the capitalised form, and constitutes
in each transaction, or "deal," a deduction or abstraction
from the capitalised wealth of the business community
in favor of the magnates or "interests" to whom the
gains accrue. Its proximate aim is a transfer of capitalised
wealth from other capitalists to those who so gain.
This transfer or abstraction of capitalised wealth from
the former owners is commonly effected by an augmentation
of the nominal capital, based on a (transient) advantage
inuring to the particular concerns whose capitalisation
is so augmented.[16] Any such increase of the community's
aggregate capitalisation, without a corresponding
increase of the material wealth on which the capitalisation
is based, involves, of course, in effect a redistribution
of the aggregate capitalised wealth; and in this redistribution
the great financiers are in a position to gain.
The gains in question, it will be seen, come out of the

-----File: 390.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
business community, out of invested wealth, and only remotely
and indirectly out of the community at large from
which the business community draws its income. These
gains, therefore, are a tax on commonplace business enterprise,
in much the same manner and with much the like
effects as the gains of commonplace business (ordinary
profits and interest) are a tax on industry.[17]

In a manner analogous to the old-fashioned capitalist-employer's
engrossing of the industrial community's technological
efficiency does the modern pecuniary magnate
engross the business community's capitalistic efficiency.
This capitalistic efficiency lies in the capitalist-employer's
ability--by force of the ownership of the material equipment--to
induce the industrial community, through suitable
bargaining, to turn over to the owner of the material
equipment the excess of the product above the industrial
community's livelihood. The fortunes of the capitalist-employer
are closely dependent on the run of the market,--the
conjunctures of advantageous purchase and sale;
and it is his constant endeavor to create or gain for himself
some peculiar degree of advantage in the market, in
the way of monopoly, good-will, legalised privilege, and
the like,--something in the way of intangible assets.
But the pecuniary magnate, in the measure in which he
truly answers to the concept, is superior to the market on
which the capitalist-employer depends, and can make or

[Footnote 17: As should be evident from the run of the argument in the
earlier portions of this paper, the use of the words "tax," "deduction,"
"abstraction," in this connection, is not to be taken as
implying approval or disapproval of the phenomena so characterised.
The words are used for want of better terms to indicate
the source of business gains, and objectively to characterise the
relation of give-and-take between industry and ordinary capitalistic
business, on the one hand, and between ordinary business
and this business enterprise on the higher plane, on the other
hand.]
-----File: 391.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
mar its conjunctures of advantageous purchase and sale
of goods; that is to say, he is in a position to make or mar
any peculiar advantage possessed by the given capitalist-employer
who comes in his way. He does this by force
of his large holdings of capital at large, the weight of
which he can shift from one point of investment to another
as the relative efficiency--earning-capacity--of
one and another line of investment may make it expedient;
and at each move of this kind, in so far as it is effective
for his ends, he cuts into and assimilates a fraction of
the invested wealth involved, in that he cuts into and
sequesters a fraction of the capital's earning-capacity in
the given line. That is to say, in the measure in which he
is a pecuniary magnate, and not simply a capitalist-employer,
he engrosses the capitalistic efficiency of invested
wealth; he turns to his own account the capitalist-employer's
effectual engrossing of the community's industrial
efficiency. He engrosses the community's pecuniary
initiative and proficiency. In the measure, therefore,
in which this relatively new-found serviceability of
extraordinarily large wealth is effective for its peculiar
business function, the old-fashioned capitalist-employer
loses his discretionary initiative and becomes a mediator,
an instrumentality of extraction and transmission, a collector
and conveyer of revenue from the community at
large to the pecuniary magnate, who, in the ideal case,
should leave him only such an allowance out of the gross
earnings collected and transmitted as will induce him to
continue in business.

To the community at large, whose industrial efficiency
is already virtually engrossed by the capitalist-employer's
ownership and control of the material equipment, this
later step in the evolution of the economic situation
should apparently not be a matter of substantial conse-*
-----File: 392.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
*quence or a matter for sentimental disturbance. On
the face of it, it should appear to have little more than
a speculative interest for those classes of the community
who do not derive an income from investments; particularly
not for the working classes, who own nothing to
speak of and whose only dependence is their technological
efficiency, which has virtually ceased to be their own.
But such is not the current state of sentiment. This inchoate
new phase of capitalism, this business enterprise
on the higher plane, is in fact viewed with the most lively
apprehension. In a maze of consternation and solicitude
the boldest, wisest, most public-spirited, most illustrious
gentlemen of our time are spending their manhood in an
endeavor to make the hen continue sitting on the nest
after the chickens are out of the shell. The modern community
is imbued with business principles--of the old
dispensation. By precept and example, men have learned
that the business interests (of the authentic superannuated
scale and kind) are the palladium of our civilisation,
as Mr. Dooley would say; and it is felt that any disturbance
of the existing pecuniary dominion of the capitalist-employer--as
contrasted with the pecuniary magnate--would
involve the well-being of the community in one
common agony of desolation.

The merits of this perturbation, or of the remedies
proposed for saving the pecuniary life of the old-fashioned
capitalist-employer, of course do not concern the
present inquiry; but the matter has been referred to here
as evidence that the pecuniary magnate's work, and the
dominion which his extraordinarily large wealth gives
him, are, in effect, substantially a new phase of the economic
development, and that these phenomena are distastefully
unfamiliar and are felt to be consequential
enough to threaten the received institutional structure.
-----File: 393.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
That is to say, it is felt to be a new phase of business
enterprise,--distasteful to those who stand to lose by it.

The basis of this business enterprise on the higher plane
is capital-at-large, as distinguished from capital invested
in a given line of industrial enterprise, and it becomes
effective when wealth has accumulated in holdings sufficiently
large to give the holder (or combination of holders,
the "system") a controlling weight in any group or
ramification of business interests into which he may throw
his weight by judicious investment (or by underwriting
and the like). The pecuniary magnate must be able effectually
to engross the pecuniary initiative and the business
opportunities on which such a section or ramification
of the business community depends for its ordinary gains.
How large a proportion of the business community's
capital is needed for such an effectual engrossing of its
capitalistic efficiency, in any given bearing, is a question
that cannot be answered in anything like absolute terms,
or even in relative terms of a satisfactorily definite kind.
It is, of course, evident that a relatively large disposable
body of capital is needed for such a purpose; and it is
also evident, from the current facts of business, that the
body of capital so disposed of need not amount to a majority,
or anything near a majority, of the investments
involved,--at least not at the present relatively inchoate
phase of this larger business enterprise. The larger the
holdings of the magnate, the more effectual and expeditious
will be his work of absorbing the holdings of the
smaller capitalist-employer, and the more precipitately
will the latter yield his assets to the new claimant.

Evidently, this work of the pecuniary magnate bears
a great resemblance to the creation of intangible assets
under the ordinary competitive system. This is, no doubt,
the point of its nearest relation to the current capitalistic
-----File: 394.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
enterprise. But, as has already been indicated above, it
cannot be said that the magnate's peculiar work is the
creation of intangible, or other assets, although there is
commonly some recapitalisation involved in his man≈ìuvers,
and although his gains commonly come as assets, <i>i.e.</i>,
in the capitalised form. Nor can it, as has also been
indicated above, be said that the wealth which serves him
as the means of his peculiar enterprise stands in the
relation of assets to this enterprise or to the gains in
question, since this wealth already stands in an exhaustive
relation as assets to some corporate enterprise in ordinary
business and to the corresponding items of interest
and dividends. It may, of course, be contended that the
present state of things on this higher plane of enterprise
is transient and transitional only, and that in the settled
condition which may conceivably supervene, the magnate's
relation to business at large will be capitalised in
some form of intangible assets, after the manner in which
the monopoly advantage of an ordinary "trust" is now
capitalised. But this is at the best only a surmise, guided
by inapplicable generalisations drawn from a past situation
in which this higher enterprise has not engrossed
the pecuniary initiative and played the ruling part.

SOME NEGLECTED POINTS IN THE
THEORY OF SOCIALISM[1]


The immediate occasion for the writing of this paper
was given by the publication of Mr. Spencer's essay,
"From Freedom to Bondage";[2] although it is not altogether
a criticism of that essay. It is not my purpose
to controvert the position taken by Mr. Spencer as regards
the present feasibility of any socialist scheme.
The paper is mainly a suggestion, offered in the spirit
of the disciple, with respect to a point not adequately
covered by Mr. Spencer's discussion, and which has
received but very scanty attention at the hands of any
other writer on either side of the socialist controversy.
This main point is as to an economic ground, as a matter
of fact, for the existing unrest that finds expression in
the demands of socialist agitators.

I quote from Mr. Spencer's essay a sentence which does
fair justice, so far as it goes, to the position taken by
agitators: "In presence of obvious improvements, joined
with that increase of longevity, which even alone yields
conclusive proof of general amelioration, it is proclaimed,
with increasing vehemence, that things are so bad that
society must be pulled to pieces and reorganised on another
plan." The most obtrusive feature of the change
demanded by the advocates of socialism is governmental
control of the industrial activities of society--the na-*

Academy of Political and Social Science</i>, Vol. II, 1892.]

Mackay.]
-----File: 396.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*tionalisation of industry. There is also, just at present,
a distinct movement in practice, towards a more extended
control of industry by the government, as Mr.
Spencer has pointed out. This movement strengthens
the position of the advocates of a complete nationalisation
of industry, by making it appear that the logic of
events is on their side.

In America at least, this movement in the direction of
a broader assertion of the paramount claims of the community,
and an extension of corporate action on part of
the community in industrial matters, has not generally
been connected with or based on an adherence to socialistic
dogmas. This is perhaps truer of the recent past
than of the immediate present. The motive of the movement
has been, in large part, the expediency of each particular
step taken. Municipal supervision, and, possibly,
complete municipal control, has come to be a necessity
in the case of such industries--mostly of recent growth--as
elementary education, street-lighting, water-supply,
etc. Opinions differ widely as to how far the community
should take into its own hands such industries
as concern the common welfare, but the growth of sentiment
may fairly be said to favor a wider scope of governmental
control.

But the necessity of some supervision in the interest
of the public extends to industries which are not simply
of municipal importance. The modern development of
industry and of the industrial organisation of society
makes it increasingly necessary that certain industries--often
spoken of as "natural monopolies"--should be
treated as being of a semi-public character. And through
the action of the same forces a constantly increasing number
of occupations are developing into the form of "natural
monopolies."
-----File: 397.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------

The motive of the movement towards corporate action
on the part of the community--State control of industry--has
been largely that of industrial expediency.
But another motive has gone with this one, and has
grown more prominent as the popular demands in this
direction have gathered wider support and taken more
definite form. The injustice, the inequality, of the existing
system, so far as concerns these natural monopolies
especially, are made much of. There is a distinct unrest
abroad, a discontent with things as they are, and the cry
of injustice is the expression of this more or less widely
prevalent discontent. This discontent is the truly socialistic
element in the situation.

It is easy to make too much of this popular unrest.
The clamor of the agitators might be taken to indicate
a wider prevalence and a greater acuteness of popular
discontent than actually exists; but after all due allowance
is made for exaggeration on the part of those interested
in the agitation, there can still be no doubt of the
presence of a chronic feeling of dissatisfaction with the
working of the existing industrial system, and a growth
of popular sentiment in favor of a leveling policy. The
economic ground of this popular feeling must be found,
if we wish to understand the significance, for our industrial
system, of the movement to which it supplies the
motive. If its causes shall appear to be of a transient
character, there is little reason to apprehend a permanent
or radical change of our industrial system as the outcome
of the agitation; while if this popular sentiment is found
to be the outgrowth of any of the essential features of
the existing social system, the chances of its ultimately
working a radical change in the system will be much
greater.

The explanation offered by Mr. Spencer, that the popu-*
-----File: 398.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
*lar unrest is due essentially to a feeling of <i>ennui</i>--to a
desire for a change of posture on part of the social body,
is assuredly not to be summarily rejected; but the analogy
will hardly serve to explain the sentiment away. This
may be a cause, but it can hardly be accepted as a sufficient
cause.

Socialist agitators urge that the existing system is necessarily
wasteful and industrially inefficient. That may
be granted, but it does not serve to explain the popular
discontent, because the popular opinion, in which the
discontent resides, does notoriously not favor that view.
They further urge that the existing system is unjust, in
that it gives an advantage to one man over another. That
contention may also be true, but it is in itself no explanation,
for it is true only if it be granted that the institutions
which make this advantage of one man over another
possible are unjust, and that is begging the question.
This last contention is, however, not so far out
of line with popular sentiment. The advantage complained
of lies, under modern conditions, in the possession
of property, and there is a feeling abroad that the
existing order of things affords an undue advantage to
property, especially to owners of property whose possessions
rise much above a certain rather indefinite average.
This feeling of injured justice is not always distinguishable
from envy; but it is, at any rate, a factor that works
towards a leveling policy. With it goes a feeling of
slighted manhood, which works in the same direction.
Both these elements are to a great extent of a subjective
origin. They express themselves in the general, objective
form, but it is safe to say that on the average they
spring from a consciousness of disadvantage and slight
suffered by the person expressing them, and by persons
whom he classes with himself. No flippancy is intended
-----File: 399.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\BabsP\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
in saying that the rich are not so generally alive to the
necessity of any leveling policy as are people of slender
means. Any question as to the legitimacy of the dissatisfaction,
on moral grounds, or even on grounds of
expediency, is not very much to the point; the question
is as to its scope and its chances of persistence.

The modern industrial system is based on the institution
of private property under free competition, and it
cannot be claimed that these institutions have heretofore
worked to the detriment of the material interests of the
average member of society. The ground of discontent
cannot lie in a disadvantageous comparison of the present
with the past, so far as material interests are concerned.
It is notorious, and, practically, none of the agitators
deny, that the system of industrial competition,
based on private property, has brought about, or has at
least co-existed with, the most rapid advance in average
wealth and industrial efficiency that the world has seen.
Especially can it fairly be claimed that the result of the
last few decades of our industrial development has been
to increase greatly the creature comforts within the reach
of the average human being. And, decidedly, the result
has been an amelioration of the lot of the less favored
in a relatively greater degree than that of those economically
more fortunate. The claim that the system of
competition has proved itself an engine for making the
rich richer and the poor poorer has the fascination of
epigram; but if its meaning is that the lot of the average,
of the masses of humanity in civilised life, is worse
to-day, as measured in the means of livelihood, than it
was twenty, or fifty, or a hundred years ago, then it is
farcical. The cause of discontent must be sought elsewhere
than in any increased difficulty in obtaining the
means of subsistence or of comfort. But there is a sense
-----File: 400.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\BabsP\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
in which the aphorism is true, and in it lies at least a
partial explanation of the unrest which our conservative
people so greatly deprecate. The existing system has not
made, and does not tend to make, the industrious poor
poorer as measured absolutely in means of livelihood;
but it does tend to make them relatively poorer, in their
own eyes, as measured in terms of comparative economic
importance, and, curious as it may seem at first sight,
that is what seems to count. It is not the abjectly poor
that are oftenest heard protesting; and when a protest is
heard in their behalf it is through spokesmen who are
from outside their own class, and who are not delegated
to speak for them. They are not a negligible element in
the situation, but the unrest which is ground for solicitude
does not owe its importance to them. The protest
comes from those who do not habitually, or of necessity,
suffer physical privation. The qualification "of necessity,"
is to be noticed. There is a not inconsiderable
amount of physical privation suffered by many people
in this country, which is not physically necessary. The
cause is very often that what might be the means of
comfort is diverted to the purpose of maintaining a decent
appearance, or even a show of luxury.

Man as we find him to-day has much regard to his
good fame--to his standing in the esteem of his fellowmen.
This characteristic he always has had, and no
doubt always will have. This regard for reputation may
take the noble form of a striving after a good name;
but the existing organisation of society does not in any
way preeminently foster that line of development. Regard
for one's reputation means, in the average of cases,
emulation. It is a striving to be, and more immediately
to be thought to be, better than one's neighbor. Now,
modern society, the society in which competition without
-----File: 401.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\-
prescription is predominant, is pre√´minently an industrial,
economic society, and it is industrial--economic--excellence
that most readily attracts the approving regard of
that society. Integrity and personal worth will, of course,
count for something, now as always; but in the case of a
person of moderate pretentions and opportunities, such as
the average of us are, one's reputation for excellence in
this direction does not penetrate far enough into the very
wide environment to which a person is exposed in modern
society to satisfy even a very modest craving for respectability.
To sustain one's dignity--and to sustain one's
self-respect--under the eyes of people who are not socially
one's immediate neighbors, it is necessary to display
the token of economic worth, which practically coincides
pretty closely with economic success. A person may
be well-born and virtuous, but those attributes will not
bring respect to the bearer from people who are not aware
of his possessing them, and these are ninety-nine out of
every one hundred that one meets. Conversely, by the
way, knavery and vulgarity in any person are not reprobated
by people who know nothing of the person's shortcomings
in those respects.

In our fundamentally industrial society a person should
be economically successful, if he would enjoy the esteem
of his fellowmen. When we say that a man is "worth"
so many dollars, the expression does not convey the idea
that moral or other personal excellence is to be measured
in terms of money, but it does very distinctly convey the
idea that the fact of his possessing many dollars is very
much to his credit. And, except in cases of extraordinary
excellence, efficiency in any direction which is not immediately
of industrial importance, and does not redound to
a person's economic benefit, is not of great value as a
means of respectability. Economic success is in our day
-----File: 402.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\----
the most widely accepted as well as the most readily ascertainable
measure of esteem. All this will hold with still
greater force of a generation which is born into a world
already encrusted with this habit of a mind.

But there is a further, secondary stage in the development
of this economic emulation. It is not enough to
possess the talisman of industrial success. In order that
it may mend one's good fame efficiently, it is necessary to
display it. One does not "make much of a showing" in
the eyes of the large majority of the people whom one
meets with, except by unremitting demonstration of ability
to pay. That is practically the only means which the
average of us have of impressing our respectability on the
many to whom we are personally unknown, but whose
transient good opinion we would so gladly enjoy. So it
comes about that the appearance of success is very much
to be desired, and is even in many cases preferred to the
substance. We all know how nearly indispensable it is
to afford whatever expenditure other people with whom
we class ourselves can afford, and also that it is desirable
to afford a little something more than others.

This element of human nature has much to do with the
"standard of living." And it is of a very elastic nature,
capable of an indefinite extension. After making proper
allowance for individual exceptions and for the action of
prudential restraints, it may be said, in a general way, that
this emulation in expenditure stands ever ready to absorb
any margin of income that remains after ordinary physical
wants and comforts have been provided for, and, further,
that it presently becomes as hard to give up that part
of one's habitual "standard of living" which is due to the
struggle for respectability, as it is to give up many physical
comforts. In a general way, the need of expenditure
in this direction grows as fast as the means of satisfying
-----File: 403.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\-
it, and, in the long run, a large expenditure comes no
nearer satisfying the desire than a smaller one.

It comes about through the working of this principle
that even the creature comforts, which are in themselves
desirable, and, it may even be, requisite to a life on a
passably satisfactory plane, acquire a value as a means of
respectability quite independent of, and out of proportion
to, their simple utility as a means of livelihood. As we
are all aware, the chief element of value in many articles
of apparel is not their efficiency for protecting the body,
but for protecting the wearer's respectability; and that not
only in the eyes of one's neighbors but even in one's own
eyes. Indeed, it happens not very rarely that a person
chooses to go ill-clad in order to be well dressed. Much
more than half the value of what is worn by the American
people may confidently be put down to the element of
"dress," rather than to that of "clothing." And the
chief motive of dress is emulation--"economic emulation."
The like is true, though perhaps in a less degree,
of what goes to food and shelter.

This misdirection of effort through the cravings of human
vanity is of course not anything new, nor is "economic
emulation" a modern fact. The modern system
of industry has not invented emulation, nor has even this
particular form of emulation originated under that system.
But the system of free competition has accentuated
this form of emulation, both by exalting the industrial
activity of man above the rank which it held under more
primitive forms of social organisation, and by in great
measure cutting off other forms of emulation from the
chance of efficiently ministering to the craving for a good
fame. Speaking generally and from the standpoint of
the average man, the modern industrial organization of
society has practically narrowed the scope of emulation
-----File: 404.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\----
to this one line; and at the same time it has made the
means of sustenance and comfort so much easier to obtain
as very materially to widen the margin of human exertion
that can be devoted to purposes of emulation. Further,
by increasing the freedom of movement of the individual
and widening the environment to which the individual is
exposed--increasing the number of persons before whose
eyes each one carries on his life, and, <i>pari passu</i>, decreasing
the chances which such persons have of awarding
their esteem on any other basis than that of immediate
appearances, it has increased the relative efficiency of the
economic means of winning respect through a show of
expenditure for personal comforts.

It is not probable that further advance in the same direction
will lead to a different result in the immediate
future; and it is the <i>immediate</i> future we have to deal
with. A further advance in the efficiency of our industry,
and a further widening of the human environment to
which the individual is exposed, should logically render
emulation in this direction more intense. There are, indeed,
certain considerations to be set off against this tendency,
but they are mostly factors of slow action, and are
hardly of sufficient consequence to reverse the general
rule. On the whole, other things remaining the same, it
must be admitted that, within wide limits, the easier the
conditions of physical life for modern civilised man become,
and the wider the horizon of each and the extent
of the personal contact of each with his fellowmen, and
the greater the opportunity of each to compare notes with
his fellows, the greater will be the preponderance of economic
success as a means of emulation, and the greater
the straining after economic respectability. Inasmuch as
the aim of emulation is not any absolute degree of comfort
or of excellence, no advance in the average well-*
-----File: 405.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\----
*being of the community can end the struggle or lessen the
strain. A general amelioration cannot quiet the unrest
whose source is the craving of everybody to compare favorably
with his neighbor.

Human nature being what it is, the struggle of each to
possess more than his neighbor is inseparable from the
institution of private property. And also, human nature
being what it is, one who possesses less will, on the average,
be jealous of the one who possesses more; and
"more" means not more than the average share, but
more than the share of the person who makes the comparison.
The criterion of complacency is, largely, the
<i>de facto</i> possession or enjoyment; and the present growth
of sentiment among the body of the people--who possess
less--favors, in a vague way, a readjustment adverse
to the interests of those who possess more, and adverse to
the possibility of legitimately possessing or enjoying
"more"; that is to say, the growth of sentiment favors
a socialistic movement. The outcome of modern industrial
development has been, so far as concerns the present
purpose, to intensify emulation and the jealousy that
goes with emulation, and to focus the emulation and the
jealousy on the possession and enjoyment of material
goods. The ground of the unrest with which we are concerned
is, very largely, jealousy,--envy, if you choose;
and the ground of this particular form of jealousy, that
makes for socialism, is to be found in the institution of
private property. With private property, under modern
conditions, this jealousy and unrest are unavoidable.

The corner-stone of the modern industrial system is the
institution of private property. That institution is also
the objective point of all attacks upon the existing system
of competitive industry, whether open or covert, whether
directed against the system as a whole or against any
-----File: 406.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\-
special feature of it. It is, moreover, the ultimate ground--and,
under modern conditions, necessarily so--of the
unrest and discontent whose proximate cause is the struggle
for economic respectability. The inference seems to
be that, human nature being what it is, there can be no
peace from this--it must be admitted--ignoble form of
emulation, or from the discontent that goes with it, this
side of the abolition of private property. Whether a
larger measure of peace is in store for us after that event
shall have come to pass, is of course not a matter to be
counted on, nor is the question immediately to the point.

This economic emulation is of course not the sole
motive, nor the most important feature, of modern industrial
life; although it is in the foreground, and it pervades
the structure of modern society more thoroughly perhaps
than any other equally powerful moral factor. It would
be rash to predict that socialism will be the inevitable outcome
of a continued development of this emulation and
the discontent which it fosters, and it is by no means the
purpose of this paper to insist on such an inference. The
most that can be claimed is that this emulation is one of
the causes, if not the chief cause, of the existing unrest
and dissatisfaction with things as they are; that this unrest
is inseparable from the existing system of industrial
organisation; and that the growth of popular sentiment
under the influence of these conditions is necessarily adverse
to the institution of private property, and therefore
adverse to the existing industrial system of free competition.

<tb>

The emulation to which attention has been called in the
preceding section of this paper is not only a fact of importance
to an understanding of the unrest that is urging
us towards an untried path in social development, but it
-----File: 407.png---\ConstanceStrongarm\DocSoman\majolo\aagam\Hermit00\---
has also a bearing on the question of the practicability of
any scheme for the complete nationalisation of industry.
Modern industry has developed to such a degree of efficiency
as to make the struggle of subsistence alone, under
average conditions, relatively easy, as compared with the
state of the case a few generations ago. As I have
labored to show, the modern competitive system has at the
same time given the spirit of emulation such a direction
that the attainment of subsistence and comfort no longer
fixes, even approximately, the limit of the required aggregate
labor on the part of the community. Under modern
conditions the struggle for existence has, in a very appreciable
degree, been transformed into a struggle to keep up
appearances. The ultimate ground of this struggle to
keep up appearance by otherwise unnecessary expenditure,
is the institution of private property. Under a r√©gime
which should allow no inequality of acquisition or of
income, this form of emulation, which is due to the possibility
of such inequality, would also tend to become obsolete.
With the abolition of private property, the characteristic
of human nature which now finds its exercise in
this form of emulation, should logically find exercise in
other, perhaps nobler and socially more serviceable, activities;
it is at any rate not easy to imagine it running into
any line of action more futile or less worthy of human
effort.

Supposing the standard of comfort of the community
to remain approximately at its present average, the abolition
of the struggle to keep up economic appearances
would very considerably lessen the aggregate amount of
labor required for the support of the community. How
great a saving of labor might be effected is not easy to say.
I believe it is within the mark to suppose that the struggle
to keep up appearances is chargeable, directly and indi-*
-----File: 408.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
*rectly, with one-half the aggregate labor, and abstinence
from labor--for the standard of respectability requires
us to shun labor as well as to enjoy the fruits of it--on
part of the American people. This does not mean that
the same community, under a system not allowing private
property, could make its way with half the labor we now
put forth; but it means something more or less nearly
approaching that. Any one who has not seen our modern
social life from this point of view will find the claim
absurdly extravagant, but the startling character of the
proposition will wear off with longer and closer attention
to this aspect of the facts of everyday life. But the question
of the exact amount of waste due to this factor is
immaterial. It will not be denied that is is a fact of considerable
magnitude, and that is all that the argument
requires.

It is accordingly competent for the advocates of the
nationalisation of industry and property to claim that
even if their scheme of organisation should prove less
effective for production of goods than the present, as
measured absolutely in terms of the aggregate output of
our industry, yet the community might readily be maintained
at the present average standard of comfort. The
required aggregate output of the nation's industry would
be considerably less than at present, and there would
therefore be less necessity for that close and strenuous
industrial organisation and discipline of the members of
society under the new r√©gime, whose evils unfriendly
critics are apt to magnify. The chances of practicability
for the scheme should logically be considerably increased
by this lessening of the necessity for severe application.
The less irksome and exacting the new r√©gime, the less
chance of a reversion to the earlier system.
-----File: 409.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\------------

Under such a social order, where common labor would
no longer be a mark of peculiar economic necessity and
consequent low economic rank on part of the laborer, it is
even conceivable that labor might practically come to assume
that character of nobility in the eyes of society at
large, which it now sometimes assumes in the speculations
of the well-to-do, in their complacent moods. Much has
sometimes been made of this possibility by socialist speculators,
but the inference has something of a utopian look,
and no one, certainly, is entitled to build institutions for
the coming social order on this dubious ground.

What there seems to be ground for claiming is that a
society which has reached our present degree of industrial
efficiency would not go into the Socialist or Nationalist
state with as many chances of failure as a community
whose industrial development is still at the stage at which
strenuous labor on the part of nearly all members is
barely sufficient to make both ends meet.

In Mr. Spencer's essay, in conformity with the line of
argument of his "Principles of Sociology," it is pointed
out that, as the result of constantly operative social forces,
all social systems, as regards the form of organisation,
fall into the one or the other of Sir Henry Maine's two
classes--the system of status or the system of contract.
In accordance with this generalisation it is concluded that
whenever the modern system of contract or free competition
shall be displaced, it will necessarily be replaced by
the only other known system--that of status; the type of
which is the military organisation, or, also, a hierarchy,
or a bureaucracy. It is something after the fashion of
the industrial organisation of ancient Peru that Mr. Spencer
pictures as the inevitable sequel of the demise of the
existing competitive system. Voluntary co√∂peration can
-----File: 410.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
be replaced only by compulsory co√∂peration, which is
identified with the system of status and defined as the
subjection of man to his fellow-man.

Now, at least as a matter of speculation, this is not the
only alternative. These two systems, of status, or prescription,
and of contract, or competition, have divided the
field of social organisation between them in some proportion
or other in the past. Mr. Spencer has shown that,
very generally, where human progress in its advanced
stages has worked towards the amelioration of the lot of
the average member of society, the movement has been
away from the system of status and towards the system of
contract. But there is at least one, if not more than one
exception to the rule, as concerns the recent past. The
latest development of the industrial organisation among
civilised nations--perhaps in an especial degree in the
case of the American people--has not been entirely a
continuation of the approach to a r√©gime of free contract.
It is also, to say the least, very doubtful if the movement
has been towards a r√©gime of status, in the sense in which
Sir Henry Maine uses the term. This is especially evident
in the case of the great industries which we call
"natural monopolies"; and it is to be added that the
present tendency is for a continually increasing proportion
of the industrial activities of the community to fall
into the category of "natural monopolies." No revolution
has been achieved; the system of competition has
not been discarded, but the course of industrial development
is not in the direction of an extension of that system
at all points; nor does the principle of status always
replace that of competition wherever the latter fails.

The classification of methods of social organisation
under the two heads of status or of contract, is not logically
exhaustive. There is nothing in the meaning of the
-----File: 411.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
terms employed which will compel us to say that whenever
man escapes from the control of his fellow man,
under a system of status, he thereby falls into a system
of free contract. There is a conceivable escape from
the dilemma, and it is this conceivable, though perhaps
impracticable, escape from both these systems that the
socialist agitator wishes to effect. An acquaintance with
the aims and position of the more advanced and consistent
advocates of a new departure leaves no doubt but that
the principles of contract and of status, both, are in substance
familiar to their thoughts--though often in a
vague and inadequate form--and that they distinctly
repudiate both. This is perhaps less true of those who
take the socialist position mainly on ethical grounds.

As bearing on this point it may be remarked that while
the industrial system, in the case of all communities with
whose history we are acquainted, has always in the past
been organised according to a scheme of status or of
contract, or of the two combined in some proportion, yet
the social organisation has not in all cases developed along
the same lines, so far as concerns such social functions as
are not primarily industrial. Especially is this true of the
later stages in the development of those communities
whose institutions we are accustomed to contemplate with
the most complacency, <i>e.g.</i>, the case of the English-speaking
peoples. The whole system of modern constitutional
government in its latest developed forms, in theory
at least, and, in a measure, in practice, does not fall
under the head of either contract or status. It is the
analogy of modern constitutional government through an
impersonal law and impersonal institutions, that comes
nearest doing justice to the vague notions of our socialist
propagandists. It is true, some of the most noted among
them are fond of the analogy of the military organisation,
-----File: 412.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
as a striking illustration of one feature of the system they
advocate, but that must after all be taken as an <i>obiter
dictum</i>.

Further, as to the manner of the evolution of existing
institutions and their relation to the two systems spoken
of. So far as concerns the communities which have figured
largely in the civilised world, the political organisation
has had its origin in a military system of government.
So, also, has the industrial organisation. But while the
development of industry, during its gradual escape from
the military system of status, has been, at least until lately,
in the direction of a system of free contract, the development
of the political organisation, so far as it has escaped
from the r√©gime of status, has not been in that direction.
The system of status is a system of subjection to personal
authority,--of prescription and class distinctions, and
privileges and immunities; the system of constitutional
government, especially as seen at its best among a people
of democratic traditions and habits of mind, is a system of
subjection to the will of the social organism, as expressed
in an impersonal law. This difference between the system
of status and the "constitutional system" expresses
a large part of the meaning of the boasted free institutions
of the English-speaking people. Here, subjection is
not to the person of the public functionary, but to the
powers vested in him. This has, of course, something of
the ring of latter-day popular rhetoric, but it is after all
felt to be true, not only speculatively, but in some measure
also in practice.

The right of eminent domain and the power to tax, as
interpreted under modern constitutional forms, indicate
something of the direction of development of the political
functions of society at a point where they touch the province
of the industrial system. It is along the line indi-*
-----File: 413.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
*cated by these and kindred facts that the socialists are
advancing; and it is along this line that the later developments
made necessary by the exigencies of industry under
modern conditions are also moving. The aim of the
propagandists is to sink the industrial community in the
political community; or perhaps better, to identify the two
organisations; but always with insistence on the necessity
of making the political organisation, in some further developed
form, the ruling and only one in the outcome.
Distinctly, the system of contract is to be done away
with; and equally distinctly, no system of status is to take
its place.

All this is pretty vague, and of a negative character, but
it would quickly pass the limits of legitimate inference
from the accepted doctrines of the socialists if it should
attempt to be anything more. It does not have much
to say as to the practicability of any socialist scheme. As
a matter of speculation, there seems to be an escape from
the dilemma insisted on by Mr. Spencer. We may conceivably
have nationalism without status and without contract.
In theory, both principles are entirely obnoxious
to that system. The practical question, as to whether
modern society affords the materials out of which an
industrial structure can be erected on a system different
from either of these, is a problem of constructive social
engineering which calls for a consideration of details far
too comprehensive to be entered on here. Still, in view
of the past course of development of character and institutions
on the part of the people to which we belong, it is
perhaps not extravagant to claim that no form of organisation
which should necessarily eventuate in a thorough-*going
system of status could endure among us. The inference
from this proposition may be, either that a near
approach to nationalisation of industry would involve a
-----File: 414.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
r√©gime of status, a bureaucracy, which would be unendurable,
and which would therefore drive us back to the
present system before it had been entirely abandoned; or
that the nationalisation would be achieved with such a
measure of success, in conformity with the requirements
of our type of character, as would make it preferable to
what we had left behind. In either case the ground for
alarm does not seem so serious as is sometimes imagined.

A reversion to the system of free competition, after it
had been in large part discarded, would no doubt be a
matter of great practical difficulty, and the experiment
which should demonstrate the necessity of such a step
might involve great waste and suffering, and might seriously
retard the advance of the race toward something
better than our present condition; but neither a permanent
deterioration of human society, nor a huge catastrophe,
is to be confidently counted on as the outcome of the
movement toward nationalisation, even if it should prove
necessary for society to retrace its steps.

It is conceivable that the application of what may be
called the "constitutional method" to the organisation of
industry--for that is essentially what the advocates of
Nationalisation demand--would result in a course of
development analogous to what has taken place in the case
of the political organisation under modern constitutional
forms. Modern constitutional government--the system
of modern free institutions--is by no means an unqualified
success, in the sense of securing to each the rights
and immunities which in theory are guaranteed to him.

Our modern republics have hardly given us a foretaste
of that political millennium whereof they proclaim the fruition.
The average human nature is as yet by no means
entirely fit for self-government according to the "constitutional
method." Shortcomings are visible at every
-----File: 415.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\mdmcdaniel\aagam\Hermit00\----------
turn. These shortcomings are grave enough to furnish
serious arguments against the practicability of our free
institutions. On the continent of Europe the belief seems
to be at present in the ascendant that man must yet, for a
long time, remain under the tutelage of absolutism before
he shall be fit to organise himself into an autonomous
political body. The belief is not altogether irrational.
Just how great must be the advance of society and
just what must be the character of the advance, preliminary
to its advantageously assuming the autonomous--republican--form
of political organisation, must be
admitted to be an open question. Whether we, or any
people, have yet reached the required stage of the advance
is also questioned by many. But the partial success
which has attended the movement in this direction, among
the English-speaking people for example, goes very far
towards proving that the point in the development of
human character at which the constitutional method may
be advantageously adopted in the political field, lies far
this side the point at which human nature shall have become
completely adapted for that method. That is to
say, it does not seem necessary, as regards the functions
of society which we are accustomed to call political, to be
entirely ready for nationalisation before entering upon it.
How far the analogy of this will hold when applied to the
industrial organisation of society is difficult to say, but
some significance the analogy must be admitted to possess.

Certainly, the fact that constitutional government--the
nationalisation of political functions--seems to have
been a move in the right direction is not to be taken as
proof of the advisability of forthwith nationalising the
industrial functions. At the same time this fact does afford
ground for the claim that a movement in this direction
may prove itself in some degree advantageous, even
-----File: 416.png---\Pitirim\DocSoman\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
if it takes place at a stage in the development of human
nature at which mankind is still far from being entirely
fit for the duties which the new system shall impose.
The question, therefore, is not whether we have reached
the perfection of character which would be necessary in
order to a perfect working of the scheme of nationalisation
of industry, but whether we have reached such a
degree of development as would make an imperfect working
of the scheme possible.

THE SOCIALIST ECONOMICS OF KARL MARX
AND HIS FOLLOWERS[1]


I. <sc>The Theories of Karl Marx</sc>

The system of doctrines worked out by Marx is characterised
by a certain boldness of conception and a great
logical consistency. Taken in detail, the constituent elements
of the system are neither novel nor iconoclastic, nor
does Marx at any point claim to have discovered previously
hidden facts or to have invented recondite formulations
of facts already known; but the system as a whole
has an air of originality and initiative such as is rarely
met with among the sciences that deal with any phase of
human culture. How much of this distinctive character
the Marxian system owes to the personal traits of its creator
is not easy to say, but what marks it off from all
other systems of economic theory is not a matter of personal
idiosyncrasy. It differs characteristically from all
systems of theory that had preceded it, both in its premises
and in its aims. The (hostile) critics of Marx have
not sufficiently appreciated the radical character of his
departure in both of these respects, and have, therefore,
commonly lost themselves in a tangled scrutiny of supposedly
abstruse details; whereas those writers who have
been in sympathy with his teachings have too commonly
been disciples bent on exegesis and on confirming their
fellow-disciples in the faith.

[Footnote 1: The substance of lectures before students in Harvard University
in April, 1906. Reprinted by permission from <i>The Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, Vol. XX, Aug., 1906]
-----File: 418.png---\bareave27\sirathiel\majolo\aagam\Hermit00\-----------

Except as a whole and except in the light of its postulates
and aims, the Marxian system is not only not tenable,
but it is not even intelligible. A discussion of a
given isolated feature of the system (such as the theory
of value) from the point of view of classical economics
(such as that offered by B√∂hm-Bawerk) is as futile as a
discussion of solids in terms of two dimensions.

Neither as regards his postulates and preconceptions
nor as regards the aim of his inquiry is Marx's position an
altogether single-minded one. In neither respect does his
position come of a single line of antecedents. He is of
no single school of philosophy, nor are his ideals those of
any single group of speculators living before his time.
For this reason he takes his place as an originator of a
school of thought as well as the leader of a movement
looking to a practical end.

As to the motives which drive him and the aspirations
which guide him, in destructive criticism and in creative
speculation alike, he is primarily a theoretician busied
with the analysis of economic phenomena and their organisation
into a consistent and faithful system of scientific
knowledge; but he is, at the same time, consistently
and tenaciously alert to the bearing which each step in the
progress of his theoretical work has upon the propaganda.
His work has, therefore, an air of bias, such as belongs to
an advocate's argument; but it is not, therefore, to be
assumed, nor indeed to be credited, that his propagandist
aims have in any substantial way deflected his inquiry or
his speculations from the faithful pursuit of scientific
truth. His socialistic bias may color his polemics, but
his logical grasp is too neat and firm to admit of any bias,
other than that of his metaphysical preconceptions, affecting
his theoretical work.

There is no system of economic theory more logical
-----File: 419.png---\bareave27\sirathiel\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
than that of Marx. No member of the system, no single
article of doctrine, is fairly to be understood, criticised,
or defended except as an articulate member of the whole
and in the light of the preconceptions and postulates
which afford the point of departure and the controlling
norm of the whole. As regards these preconceptions and
postulates, Marx draws on two distinct lines of antecedents,--the
Materialistic Hegelianism and the English
system of Natural Rights. By his earlier training he is
an adept in the Hegelian method of speculation and inoculated
with the metaphysics of development underlying the
Hegelian system. By his later training he is an expert in
the system of Natural Rights and Natural Liberty, ingrained
in his ideals of life and held inviolate throughout.
He does not take a critical attitude toward the underlying
principles of Natural Rights. Even his Hegelian preconceptions
of development never carry him the length of
questioning the fundamental principles of that system.
He is only more ruthlessly consistent in working out their
content than his natural-rights antagonists in the liberal-classical
school. His polemics run against the specific
tenets of the liberal school, but they run wholly on the
ground afforded by the premises of that school. The
ideals of his propaganda are natural-rights ideals, but his
theory of the working out of these ideals in the course of
history rests on the Hegelian metaphysics of development,
and his method of speculation and construction of theory
is given by the Hegelian dialectic.

<tb>

What first and most vividly centered interest on Marx
and his speculations was his relation to the revolutionary
socialistic movement; and it is those features of his doctrines
which bear immediately on the propaganda that
still continue to hold the attention of the greater number
-----File: 420.png---\bareave27\sirathiel\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
of his critics. Chief among these doctrines, in the apprehension
of his critics, is the theory of value, with its
corollaries: (<i>a</i>) the doctrines of the exploitation of labor
by capital; and (<i>b</i>) the laborer's claim to the whole product
of his labor. Avowedly, Marx traces his doctrine of
labor-value to Ricardo, and through him to the classical
economists.[2] The laborer's claim to the whole product
of labor, which is pretty constantly implied, though not
frequently avowed by Marx, he has in all probability
taken from English writers of the early nineteenth century,[3]
more particularly from William Thompson. These
doctrines are, on their face, nothing but a development of
the conceptions of natural rights which then pervaded
English speculation and afforded the metaphysical ground
of the liberal movement. The more formidable critics of
the Marxian socialism have made much of these doctrinal
elements that further the propaganda, and have, by laying
the stress on these, diverted attention from other
elements that are of more vital consequence to the system
as a body of theory. Their exclusive interest in this
side of "scientific socialism" has even led them to deny
the Marxian system all substantial originality, and make
it a (doubtfully legitimate) offshoot of English Liberalism
and natural rights.[4] But this is one-sided criticism.
It may hold as against certain tenets of the so-called
"scientific socialism," but it is not altogether to the point
as regards the Marxian system of theory. Even the
Marxian theory of value, surplus value, and exploitation,

[Footnote 2: <i>Cf.</i> <i>Critique of Political Economy</i>, chap. i, "Notes on the
History of the Theory of Commodities," pp. 56-73 (English
translation, New York, 1904).]

iii-v and viii-ix, and Foxwell's admirable Introduction to Menger.]

[Footnote 4: See Menger and Foxwell, as above, and Schaeffle, <i>Quintessence
of Socialism</i>, and <i>The Impossibility of Social Democracy</i>.]
-----File: 421.png---\bareave27\Queexil\tenorcnj\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
is not simply the doctrine of William Thompson, transcribed
and sophisticated in a forbidding terminology,
however great the superficial resemblance and however
large Marx's unacknowledged debt to Thompson may be
on these heads. For many details and for much of his
animus Marx may be indebted to the Utilitarians; but,
after all, his system of theory, taken as a whole, lies
within the frontiers of neo-Hegelianism, and even the details
are worked out in accord with the preconceptions of
that school of thought and have taken on the complexion
that would properly belong to them on that ground. It
is, therefore, not by an itemised scrutiny of the details of
doctrine and by tracing their pedigree in detail that a fair
conception of Marx and his contribution to economics
may be reached, but rather by following him from his own
point of departure out into the ramifications of his theory,
and so overlooking the whole in the prospective which the
lapse of time now affords us, but which he could not
himself attain, since he was too near to his own work to
see why he went about it as he did.

<tb>

The comprehensive system of Marxism is comprised
within the scheme of the Materialistic Conception of
History.[5] This materialistic conception is essentially
Hegelian,[6] although it belongs with the Hegelian Left,
and its immediate affiliation is with Feuerbach, not with
the direct line of Hegelian orthodoxy. The chief point
of interest here, in identifying the materialistic conception
with Hegelianism, is that this identification throws it

[Footnote 5: See Engels, <i>The Development of Socialism from Utopia to
Science</i>, especially section ii and the opening paragraphs of
section iii; also the preface of <i>Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i>.]

[Footnote 6: See Engels, as above, and also his <i>Feuerbach: The Roots of
Socialist Philosophy</i> (translation, Chicago, Kerr & Co., 1903).]
-----File: 422.png---\Pitirim\Jack Bigelow\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
immediately and uncompromisingly into contrast with
Darwinism and the post-Darwinian conceptions of evolution.
Even if a plausible English pedigree should be
worked out for this Materialistic Conception, or "Scientific
Socialism," as has been attempted, it remains none
the less true that the conception with which Marx went
to his work was a transmuted framework of Hegelian
dialectic.[7]

Roughly, Hegelian materialism differs from Hegelian
orthodoxy by inverting the main logical sequence, not by
discarding the logic or resorting to new tests of truth or
finality. One might say, though perhaps with excessive
crudity, that, where Hegel pronounces his dictum, <i>Das
Denken ist das Sein</i>, the materialists, particularly Marx
and Engels, would say <i>Das Sein macht das Denken</i>. But
in both cases some sort of a creative primacy is assigned
to one or the other member of the complex, and in neither
case is the relation between the two members a causal
relation. In the materialistic conception man's spiritual
life--what man thinks--is a reflex of what he is in the
material respect, very much in the same fashion as the
orthodox Hegelian would make the material world a reflex
of the spirit. In both, the dominant norm of speculation
and formulation of theory is the conception of
movement, development, evolution, progress; and in both
the movement is conceived necessarily to take place by
the method of conflict or struggle. The movement is of
the nature of progress,--gradual advance toward a goal,
toward the realisation in explicit form of all that is implicit
in the substantial activity involved in the movement.
The movement is, further, self-conditioned and self-acting:
it is an unfolding by inner necessity. The struggle

[Footnote 7: See <i>e.g.</i>, Seligman, <i>The Economic Interpretation of History</i>,
Part I.]
-----File: 423.png---\Pitirim\amerisca\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
which constitutes the method of movement or evolution is,
in the Hegelian system proper, the struggle of the spirit
for self-realisation by the process of the well-known
three-phase dialectic. In the materialistic conception of
history this dialectical movement becomes the class struggle
of the Marxian system.

The class struggle is conceived to be "material," but
the term "material" is in this connection used in a metaphorical
sense. It does not mean mechanical or physical,
or even physiological, but economic. It is material in the
sense that it is a struggle between classes for the material
means of life. "The materialistic conception of history
proceeds on the principle that production and, next to production,
the exchange of its products is the groundwork
of every social order."[8] The social order takes its form
through the class struggle, and the character of the class
struggle at any given phase of the unfolding development
of society is determined by "the prevailing mode of economic
production and exchange." The dialectic of the
movement of social progress, therefore, moves on the
spiritual plane of human desire and passion, not on the
(literally) material plane of mechanical and physiological
stress, on which the developmental process of brute creation
unfolds itself. It is a sublimated materialism, sublimated
by the dominating presence of the conscious human
spirit; but it is conditioned by the material facts of the
production of the means of life.[9] The ultimately active
forces involved in the process of unfolding social life are
(apparently) the material agencies engaged in the me-*

[Footnote 9: <i>Cf.</i>, on this point, Max Adler, "Kausalit√§t und Teleologie

whom Adler criticises and claims to have refuted.]
-----File: 424.png---\Pitirim\maorarad\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
*chanics of production; but the dialectic of the process--the
class struggle--runs its course only among and in
terms of the secondary (epigenetic) forces of human
consciousness engaged in the valuation of the material
products of industry. A consistently materialistic conception,
consistently adhering to a materialistic interpretation
of the process of development as well as of the
facts involved in the process, could scarcely avoid making
its putative dialectic struggle a mere unconscious and
irrelevant conflict of the brute material forces. This
would have amounted to an interpretation in terms of
opaque cause and effect, without recourse to the concept
of a conscious class struggle, and it might have led to a
concept of evolution similar to the unteleological Darwinian
concept of natural selection. It could scarcely have
led to the Marxian notion of a conscious class struggle as
the one necessary method of social progress, though it
might conceivably, by the aid of empirical generalisation,
have led to a scheme of social process in which a class
struggle would be included as an incidental though perhaps
highly efficient factor.[10] It would have led, as Darwinism
has, to a concept of a process of cumulative
change in social structure and function; but this process,
being essentially a cumulative sequence of causation,
opaque and unteleological, could not, without an infusion
of pious fancy by the speculator, be asserted to involve
progress as distinct from retrogression or to tend to a
"realisation" or "self-realisation" of the human spirit
or of anything else. Neither could it conceivably be asserted
to lead up to a final term, a goal to which all lines
of the process should converge and beyond which the
process would not go, such as the assumed goal of the
Marxian process of class struggle, which is conceived to

[Footnote 10: <i>Cf.</i> Adler, as above.]
-----File: 425.png---\Pitirim\diogenespc\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\-------------
cease in the classless economic structure of the socialistic
final term. In Darwinism there is no such final or
perfect term, and no definitive equilibrium.

The disparity between Marxism and Darwinism, as well
as the disparity within the Marxian system between the
range of material facts that are conceived to be the fundamental
forces of the process, on the one hand, and the
range of spiritual facts within which the dialectic movement
proceeds,--this disparity is shown in the character
assigned the class struggle by Marx and Engels. The
struggle is asserted to be a conscious one, and proceeds
on a recognition by the competing classes of their mutually
incompatible interests with regard to the material
means of life. The class struggle proceeds on motives of
interest, and a recognition of class interest can, of course,
be reached only by reflection on the facts of the case.
There is, therefore, not even a direct causal connection
between the material forces in the case and the choice of
a given interested line of conduct. The attitude of the
interested party does not result from the material forces
so immediately as to place it within the relation of direct
cause and effect, nor even with such a degree of intimacy
as to admit of its being classed as a tropismatic, or even
instinctive, response to the impact of the material force
in question. The sequence of reflection, and the consequent
choice of sides to a quarrel, run entirely alongside
of a range of material facts concerned.

A further characteristic of the doctrine of class struggle
requires mention. While the concept is not Darwinian,
it is also not legitimately Hegelian, whether of the
Right or the Left. It is of a utilitarian origin and of
English pedigree, and it belongs to Marx by virtue of his
having borrowed its elements from the system of self-interest.
It is in fact a piece of hedonism, and is related
-----File: 426.png---\Pitirim\maorarad\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
to Bentham rather than to Hegel. It proceeds on the
grounds of the hedonistic calculus, which is equally foreign
to the Hegelian notion of an unfolding process and
to the post-Darwinian notions of cumulative causation.
As regards the tenability of the doctrine, apart from the
question of its derivation and its compatibility with the
neo-Hegelian postulates, it is to be added that it is quite
out of harmony with the later results of psychological inquiry,--just
as is true of the use made of the hedonistic
calculus by the classical (Austrian) economics.

<tb>

Within the domain covered by the materialistic conception,
that is to say within the domain of unfolding human
culture, which is the field of Marxian speculation at large,
Marx has more particularly devoted his efforts to an
analysis and theoretical formulation of the present situation,--the
current phase of the process, the capitalistic
system. And, since the prevailing mode of the production
of goods determines the institutional, intellectual, and
spiritual life of the epoch, by determining the form and
method of the current class struggle, the discussion necessarily
begins with the theory of "capitalistic production,"
or production as carried on under the capitalistic system.[11]

[Footnote 11: It may be noted, by way of caution to readers familiar with
the terms only as employed by the classical (English and
Austrian) economists, that in Marxian usage "capitalistic production"
means production of goods for the market by hired
labor under the direction of employers who own (or control) the
means of production and are engaged in industry for the sake of
a profit. "Capital" is wealth (primarily funds) so employed.
In these and other related points of terminological usage Marx
is, of course, much more closely in touch with colloquial usage
than those economists of the classical line who make capital
signify "the products of past industry used as aids to further
production." With Marx "Capitalism" implies certain relations
of ownership, no less than the "productive use" which is alone
insisted on by so many later economists in defining the term.]
-----File: 427.png---\Pitirim\griff4\VerenaM\aagam\Hermit00\---------------

Under the capitalistic system, that is to say under the
system of modern business traffic, production is a production
of commodities, merchantable goods, with a view to
the price to be obtained for them in the market. The
great fact on which all industry under this system hinges
is the price of marketable goods. Therefore it is at this
point that Marx strikes into the system of capitalistic production,
and therefore the theory of value becomes the
dominant feature of his economics and the point of departure
for the whole analysis, in all its voluminous ramifications.[12]

It is scarcely worth while to question what serves as
the beginning of wisdom in the current criticisms of
Marx; namely, that he offers no adequate proof of his
labor-value theory.[13] It is even safe to go farther, and
say that he offers no proof of it. The feint which occupies
the opening paragraphs of the <i>Kapital</i> and the corresponding
passages of <i>Zur Kritik</i>, etc., is not to be taken
seriously as an attempt to prove his position on this head
by the ordinary recourse to argument. It is rather a self-satisfied
superior's playful mystification of those readers
(critics) whose limited powers do not enable them to see

[Footnote 12: In the sense that the theory of value affords the point of departure
and the fundamental concepts out of which the further
theory of the workings of capitalism is constructed,--in this
sense, and in this sense only, is the theory of value the central
doctrine and the critical tenet of Marxism. It does not follow
that the Marxist doctrine of an irresistible drift towards a socialistic
consummation hangs on the defensibility of the labor-value
theory, nor even that the general structure of the Marxist economics
would collapse if translated into other terms than those
of this doctrine of labor-value. <i>Cf</i>. B√∂hm-Bawerk, <i>Karl Marx
and the Close of his System</i>; and, on the other hand, Franz Oppenheimer,

[Footnote 13: <i>Cf., e.g.</i>, B√∂hm-Bawerk, as above; Georg Adler, <i>Grundlagen
der Karl Marx'schen Kritik</i>.]
-----File: 428.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
that his proposition is self-evident. Taken on the Hegelian
(neo-Hegelian) ground, and seen in the light of the
general materialistic conception, the proposition that
value = labor-cost is self-evident, not to say tautological.
Seen in any other light, it has no particular force.

In the Hegelian scheme of things the only substantial
reality is the unfolding life of the spirit. In the neo-Hegelian
scheme, as embodied in the materialistic conception,
this reality is translated into terms of the unfolding
(material) life of man in society.[14] In so far as the
goods are products of industry, they are the output of this
unfolding life of man, a material residue embodying a
given fraction of this forceful life-process. In this life-process
lies all substantial reality, and all finally valid
relations of quantivalence between the products of this
life-process must run in its terms. The life-process,
which, when it takes the specific form of an expenditure
of labor power, goes to produce goods, is a process of
material forces, the spiritual or mental features of the
life-process and of labor being only its insubstantial reflex.
It is consequently only in the material changes wrought by
this expenditure of labor power that the metaphysical substance
of life--labor power--can be embodied; but in
these changes of material fact it cannot but be embodied,
since these are the end to which it is directed.

This balance between goods in respect of their magnitude
as output of human labor holds good indefeasibly, in

[Footnote 14: In much the same way, and with an analogous effect on their
theoretical work, in the preconceptions of the classical (including
the Austrian) economists, the balance of pleasure and pain is
taken to be the ultimate reality in terms of which all economic
theory must be stated and to terms of which all phenomena
should finally be reduced in any definitive analysis of economic
life. It is not the present purpose to inquire whether the one
of these uncritical assumptions is in any degree more meritorious
or more serviceable than the other.]
-----File: 429.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
point of the metaphysical reality of the life-process, whatever
superficial (phenomenal) variations from this norm
may occur in men's dealings with the goods under the
stress of the strategy of self-interest. Such is the value
of the goods in reality; they are equivalents of one another
in the proportion in which they partake of this substantial
quality, although their true ratio of equivalence
may never come to an adequate expression in the transactions
involved in the distribution of the goods. This real
or true value of the goods is a fact of production, and
holds true under all systems and methods of production,
whereas the exchange value (the "phenomenal form" of
the real value) is a fact of distribution, and expresses the
real value more or less adequately according as the scheme
of distribution in force at the given time conforms more
or less closely to the equities given by production. If the
output of industry were distributed to the productive
agents strictly in proportion to their shares in production,
the exchange value of the goods would be presumed
to conform to their real value. But, under the current,
capitalistic system, distribution is not in any sensible degree
based on the equities of production, and the exchange
value of goods under this system can therefore express
their real value only with a very rough, and in the main
fortuitous, approximation. Under a socialistic r√©gime,
where the laborer would get the full product of his labor,
or where the whole system of ownership, and consequently
the system of distribution, would lapse, values
would reach a true expression, if any.

Under the capitalistic system the determination of exchange
value is a matter of competitive profit-making,
and exchange values therefore depart erratically and incontinently
from the proportions that would legitimately
be given them by the real values whose only expression
-----File: 430.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
they are. Marx's critics commonly identify the concept
of "value" with that of "exchange value,"[15] and show
that the theory of "value" does not square with the run
of the facts of price under the existing system of distribution,
piously hoping thereby to have refuted the Marxian
doctrine; whereas, of course, they have for the most
part not touched it. The misapprehension of the critics
may be due to a (possibly intentional) oracular obscurity
on the part of Marx. Whether by his fault or their own,
their refutations have hitherto been quite inconclusive.
Marx's severest stricture on the iniquities of the capitalistic
system is that contained by implication in his development
of the manner in which actual exchange value of
goods systematically diverges from their real (labor-cost)
value. Herein, indeed, lies not only the inherent iniquity
of the existing system, but also its fateful infirmity, according
to Marx.

The theory of value, then, is <i>contained in</i> the main postulates
of the Marxian system rather than derived from
them. Marx identifies this doctrine, in its elements, with
the labor-value theory of Ricardo,[16] but the relationship
between the two is that of a superficial coincidence in
their main propositions rather than a substantial identity
of theoretic contents. In Ricardo's theory the source and
measure of value is sought in the effort and sacrifice
undergone by the producer, consistently, on the whole,

[Footnote 15: B√∂hm-Bawerk, <i>Capital and Interest</i>, Book VI, chap, iii; also
<i>Karl Marx and the Close of his System</i>, particularly chap. iv;
Adler, <i>Grundlagen</i>, chaps. ii. and iii.]

[Footnote 16: <i>Cf.</i> <i>Kapital</i>, vol. i, chap. xv, p. 486 (4th ed.). See also notes
9 and 16 to chap. i of the same volume, where Marx discusses
the labor-value doctrines of Adam Smith and an earlier (anonymous)
English writer, and compares them with his own. Similar
comparisons with the early--classical--value theories recur
from time to time in the later portions of <i>Kapital</i>.]
-----File: 431.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
with the Benthamite-utilitarian position to which Ricardo
somewhat loosely and uncritically adhered. The decisive
fact about labor, that quality by virtue of which it is assumed
to be the final term in the theory of production, is
its irksomeness. Such is of course not the case in the
labor-value theory of Marx, to whom the question of the
irksomeness of labor is quite irrelevant, so far as regards
the relation between labor and production. The substantial
diversity or incompatibility of the two theories shows
itself directly when each is employed by its creator in the
further analysis of economic phenomena. Since with
Ricardo the crucial point is the degree of irksomeness of
labor, which serves as a measure both of the labor expended
and the value produced, and since in Ricardo's
utilitarian philosophy there is no more vital fact underlying
this irksomeness, therefore no surplus-value theory
follows from the main position. The productiveness of
labor is not cumulative, in its own working; and the Ricardian
economics goes on to seek the cumulative productiveness
of industry in the functioning of the products
of labor when employed in further production and in the
irksomeness of the capitalist's abstinence. From which
duly follows the general position of classical economics on
the theory of production.

With Marx, on the other hand, the labor power expended
in production being itself a product and having a
substantial value corresponding to its own labor-cost, the
value of the labor power expended and the value of the
product created by its expenditure need not be the same.
They are not the same, by supposition, as they would be
in any hedonistic interpretation of the facts. Hence a
discrepancy arises between the value of the labor power
expended in production and the value of the product created,
and this discrepancy is covered by the concept of
-----File: 432.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
surplus value. Under the capitalistic system, wages
being the value (price) of the labor power consumed in
industry, it follows that the surplus product of their labor
cannot go to the laborers, but becomes the profits of
capital and the source of its accumulation and increase.
From the fact that wages are measured by the value of
labor power rather than by the (greater) value of the
product of labor, it follows also that the laborers are
unable to buy the whole product of their labor, and so
that the capitalists are unable to sell the whole product
of industry continuously at its full value, whence arise
difficulties of the gravest nature in the capitalistic system,
in the way of overproduction and the like.

But the gravest outcome of this systematic discrepancy
between the value of labor power and the value of its
product is the accumulation of capital out of unpaid labor,
and the effect of this accumulation on the laboring population.
The law of accumulation, with its corollary, the
doctrine of the industrial reserve army, is the final term
and the objective point of Marx's theory of capitalist production,
just as the theory of labor value is his point of
departure.[17] While the theory of value and surplus value
are Marx's explanation of the possibility of existence of
the capitalistic system, the law of the accumulation of
capital is his exposition of the causes which must lead to
the collapse of that system and of the manner in which
the collapse will come. And since Marx is, always and

[Footnote 17: Oppenheimer (<i>Das Grundgesetz der Marx'schen Gesellschaftslehre</i>)
is right in making the theory of accumulation the
central element in the doctrines of Marxist socialism, but it does
not follow, as Oppenheimer contends, that this doctrine is the
keystone of Marx's economic theories. It follows logically from
the theory of surplus value, as indicated above, and rests on that
theory in such a way that it would fail (in the form in which
it is held by Marx) with the failure of the doctrine of surplus
value.]
-----File: 433.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
everywhere, a socialist agitator as well as a theoretical
economist, it may be said without hesitation that the law
of accumulation is the climax of his great work, from
whatever point of view it is looked at, whether as an economic
theorem or as a tenet of socialistic doctrine.

The law of capitalistic accumulation may be paraphrased
as follows:[18] Wages being the (approximately
exact) value of the labor power bought in the wage contract;
the price of the product being the (similarly approximate)
value of the goods produced; and since the
value of the product exceeds that of the labor power by
a given amount (surplus value), which by force of the
wage contract passes into the possession of the capitalist
and is by him in part laid by as savings and added to the
capital already in hand, it follows (<i>a</i>) that, other things
equal, the larger the surplus value, the more rapid the
increase of capital; and, also (<i>b</i>), that the greater the
increase of capital relatively to the labor force employed,
the more productive the labor employed and the larger
the surplus product available for accumulation. The
process of accumulation, therefore, is evidently a cumulative
one; and, also evidently, the increase added to
capital is an unearned increment drawn from the unpaid
surplus product of labor.

But with an appreciable increase of the aggregate capital
a change takes place in its technological composition,
whereby the "constant" capital (equipment and raw
materials) increases disproportionately as compared with
the "variable" capital (wages fund). "Labor-saving
devices" are used to a greater extent than before, and
labor is saved. A larger proportion of the expenses of
production goes for the purchase of equipment and raw
materials, and a smaller proportion--though perhaps an

[Footnote 18: See <i>Kapital</i>, vol. i, chap. xxiii.]
-----File: 434.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\aagam\Hermit00\-------------
absolutely increased amount--goes for the purchase of
labor power. Less labor is needed relatively to the aggregate
capital employed as well as relatively to the quantity
of goods produced. Hence some portion of the increasing
labor supply will not be wanted, and an "industrial
reserve army," a "surplus labor population," an army of
unemployed, comes into existence. This reserve grows
relatively larger as the accumulation of capital proceeds
and as technological improvements consequently gain
ground; so that there result two divergent cumulative
changes in the situation,--antagonistic, but due to the
same set of forces and, therefore, inseparable: capital
increases, and the number of unemployed laborers (relatively)
increases also.

This divergence between the amount of capital and output,
on the one hand, and the amount received by laborers
as wages, on the other hand, has an incidental consequence
of some importance. The purchasing power of the laborers,
represented by their wages, being the largest part
of the demand for consumable goods, and being at the
same time, in the nature of the case, progressively less
adequate for the purchase of the product, represented by
the price of the goods produced, it follows that the market
is progressively more subject to glut from overproduction,
and hence to commercial crises and depression.
It has been argued, as if it were a direct inference from
Marx's position, that this maladjustment between production
and markets, due to the laborer not getting the
full product of his labor, leads directly to the breakdown
of the capitalistic system, and so by its own force will
bring on the socialistic consummation. Such is not
Marx's position, however, although crises and depression
play an important part in the course of development that
-----File: 435.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
is to lead up to socialism. In Marx's theory, socialism is
to come by way of a conscious class movement on the part
of the propertyless laborers, who will act advisedly on
their own interest and force the revolutionary movement
for their own gain. But crises and depression will have
a large share in bringing the laborers to a frame of mind
suitable for such a move.

Given a growing aggregate capital, as indicated above,
and a concomitant reserve of unemployed laborers growing
at a still higher rate, as is involved in Marx's position,
this body of unemployed labor can be, and will be, used
by the capitalists to depress wages, in order to increase
profits. Logically, it follows that, the farther and faster
capital accumulates, the larger will be the reserve of unemployed,
both absolutely and relatively to the work to
be done, and the more severe will be the pressure acting to
reduce wages and lower the standard of living, and the
deeper will be the degradation and misery of the working
class and the more precipitately will their condition decline
to a still lower depth. Every period of depression,
with its increased body of unemployed labor seeking
work, will act to hasten and accentuate the depression of
wages, until there is no warrant even for holding that
wages will, on an average, be kept up to the subsistence
minimum.[19] Marx, indeed, is explicit to the effect that
such will be the case,--that wages will decline below the
subsistence minimum; and he cites English conditions of
child labor, misery, and degeneration to substantiate his
views.[20] When this has gone far enough, when capital-*

[Footnote 19: The "subsistence minimum" is here taken in the sense used
by Marx and the classical economists, as meaning what is necessary
to keep up the supply of labor at its current rate of efficiency.]

[Footnote 20: See <i>Kapital</i>, vol. i, chap, xxiii, sections 4 and 5.]
-----File: 436.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*ist production comes near enough to occupying the whole
field of industry and has depressed the condition of its
laborers sufficiently to make them an effective majority of
the community with nothing to lose, then, having taken
advice together, they will move, by legal or extra-legal
means, by absorbing the state or by subverting it, to establish
the social revolution.

Socialism is to come through class antagonism due to
the absence of all property interests from the laboring
class, coupled with a generally prevalent misery so profound
as to involve some degree of physical degeneration.
This misery is to be brought about by the heightened productivity
of labor due to an increased accumulation of
capital and large improvements in the industrial arts;
which in turn is caused by the fact that under a system
of private enterprise with hired labor the laborer does not
get the whole product of his labor; which, again, is only
saying in other words that private ownership of capital
goods enables the capitalist to appropriate and accumulate
the surplus product of labor. As to what the r√©gime is
to be which the social revolution will bring in, Marx has
nothing particular to say, beyond the general thesis that
there will be no private ownership, at least not of the
means of production.

<tb>

Such are the outlines of the Marxian system of socialism.
In all that has been said so far no recourse is had
to the second and third volumes of <i>Kapital</i>. Nor is it
necessary to resort to these two volumes for the general
theory of socialism. They add nothing essential, although
many of the details of the processes concerned in
the working out of the capitalist scheme are treated with
greater fullness, and the analysis is carried out with great
consistency and with admirable results. For economic
-----File: 437.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\majolo\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------
theory at large these further two volumes are important
enough, but an inquiry into their contents in that connection
is not called for here.

Nothing much need be said as to the tenability of this
theory. In its essentials, or at least in its characteristic
elements, it has for the most part been given up by latter-*day
socialist writers. The number of those who hold to
it without essential deviation is growing gradually smaller.
Such is necessarily the case, and for more than one reason.
The facts are not bearing it out on certain critical
points, such as the doctrine of increasing misery; and the
Hegelian philosophical postulates, without which the
Marxism of Marx is groundless, are for the most part
forgotten by the dogmatists of to-day. Darwinism has
largely supplanted Hegelianism in their habits of thought.

The particular point at which the theory is most fragile,
considered simply as a theory of social growth, is its implied
doctrine of population,--implied in the doctrine of
a growing reserve of unemployed workmen. The doctrine
of the reserve of unemployed labor involves as a
postulate that population will increase anyway, without
reference to current or prospective means of life. The
empirical facts give at least a very persuasive apparent
support to the view expressed by Marx, that misery is, or
has hitherto been, no hindrance to the propagation of the
race; but they afford no conclusive evidence in support of
a thesis to the effect that the number of laborers must
increase independently of an increase of the means of life.
No one since Darwin would have the hardihood to say
that the increase of the human species is not conditioned
by the means of living.

But all that does not really touch Marx's position. To
Marx, the neo-Hegelian, history, including the economic
development, is the life-history of the human species;
-----File: 438.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\shadow_reader\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
and the main fact in this life-history, particularly in the
economic aspect of it, is the growing volume of human
life. This, in a manner of speaking, is the base-line of
the whole analysis of the process of economic life, including
the phase of capitalist production with the rest. The
growth of population is the first principle, the most substantial,
most material factor in this process of economic
life, so long as it is a process of growth, of unfolding, of
exfoliation, and not a phase of decrepitude and decay.
Had Marx found that his analysis led him to a view
adverse to this position, he would logically have held that
the capitalist system is the mortal agony of the race and
the manner of its taking off. Such a conclusion is precluded
by his Hegelian point of departure, according to
which the goal of the life-history of the race in a large
way controls the course of that life-history in all its
phases, including the phase of capitalism. This goal or
end, which controls the process of human development, is
the complete realisation of life in all its fullness, and the
realisation is to be reached by a process analogous to the
three-phase dialectic, of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis,
into which scheme the capitalist system, with its over-*flowing
measure of misery and degradation, fits as the last
and most dreadful phase of antithesis. Marx, as a
Hegelian,--that is to say, a romantic philosopher,--is
necessarily an optimist, and the evil (antithetical element)
in life is to him a logically necessary evil, as the antithesis
is a necessary phase of the dialectic; and it is a means to
the consummation, as the antithesis is a means to the
synthesis.

THE SOCIALIST ECONOMICS OF KARL MARX
AND HIS FOLLOWERS[1]


II. <sc>The Later Marxism</sc>

Marx worked out his system of theory in the main during
the third quarter of the nineteenth century. He came to
the work from the standpoint given him by his early
training in German thought, such as the most advanced
and aggressive German thinking was through the middle
period of the century, and he added to this German
standpoint the further premises given him by an exceptionally
close contact with and alert observation of the
English situation. The result is that he brings to his
theoretical work a twofold line of premises, or rather of
preconceptions. By early training he is a neo-Hegelian,
and from this German source he derives his peculiar formulation
of the Materialistic Theory of History. By
later experience he acquired the point of view of that
Liberal-Utilitarian school which dominated English
thought through the greater part of his active life. To
this experience he owes (probably) the somewhat pronounced
individualistic preconceptions on which the doctrines
of the Full Product of Labor and the Exploitation
of Labor are based. These two not altogether compatible
lines of doctrine found their way together into the tenets
of scientific[2] socialism, and gives its characteristic Marxian
features to the body of socialist economics.

Vol. XXI, Feb., 1907.]

[Footnote 2: "Scientific" is here used in the half-technical sense which by]*
-----File: 440.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\johnbtarzan\JackieB\Hermit00\----------

The socialism that inspires hopes and fears to-day is of
the school of Marx. No one is seriously apprehensive of
any other so-called socialistic movement, and no one is
seriously concerned to criticise or refute the doctrines set
forth by any other school of "socialists." It may be
that the socialists of the Marxist observance are not always
or at all points in consonance with the best accepted
body of Marxist doctrine. Those who make up the body
of the movement may not always be familiar with the
details--perhaps not even with the general features--of
the Marxian scheme of economics; but with such consistency
as may fairly be looked for in any popular movement,
the socialists of all countries gravitate toward the theoretical
position of the avowed Marxism. In proportion
as the movement in any given community grows in mass,
maturity, and conscious purpose, it unavoidably takes on
a more consistently Marxian complexion. It is not the
Marxism of Marx, but the materialism of Darwin, which
the socialists of to-day have adopted. The Marxist socialists
of Germany have the lead, and the socialists of
other countries largely take their cue from the German
leaders.

The authentic spokesmen of the current international
socialism are avowed Marxists. Exceptions to that rule
are very few. On the whole, the substantial truth of the
Marxist doctrines is not seriously questioned within the
lines of the socialists, though there may be some appreciable
divergence as to what the true Marxist position is
on one point and another. Much and eager controversy
circles about questions of that class.

The keepers of the socialist doctrines are passably
agreed as to the main position and the general principles.

*[Footnote: usage it often has in this connection, designating the theories of
Marx and his followers.]
-----File: 441.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\johnbtarzan\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
Indeed, so secure is this current agreement on the general
principles that a very lively controversy on matters of
detail may go on without risk of disturbing the general
position. This general position is avowedly Marxism.
But it is not precisely the position held by Karl Marx.
It has been modernised, adapted, filled out, in response to
exigencies of a later date than those which conditioned
the original formulation of the theories. It is, of course,
not admitted by the followers of Marx that any substantial
change or departure from the original position has
taken place. They are somewhat jealously orthodox, and
are impatient of any suggested "improvements" on the
Marxist position, as witness the heat engendered in the
"revisionist" controversy of a few years back. But the
jealous protests of the followers of Marx do not alter the
fact that Marxism has undergone some substantial change
since it left the hands of its creator. Now and then a
more or less consistent disciple of Marx will avow a need
of adapting the received doctrines to circumstances that
have arisen later than the formulation of the doctrines;
and amendments, qualifications, and extensions, with this
need in view, have been offered from time to time. But
more pervasive though unavowed changes have come in
the teachings of Marxism by way of interpretation and an
unintended shifting of the point of view. Virtually, the
whole of the younger generation of socialist writers shows
such a growth. A citation of personal instances would be
quite futile.

It is the testimony of his friends as well as of his
writings that the theoretical position of Marx, both as
regards his standpoint and as regards his main tenets, fell
into a definitive shape relatively early, and that his later
work was substantially a working out of what was con-*

*tained in the position taken at the outset of his career.[3]
By the latter half of the forties, if not by the middle of
the forties, Marx and Engels had found the outlook on
human life which came to serve as the point of departure
and the guide for their subsequent development of theory.
Such is the view of the matter expressed by Engels during
the later years of his life.[4] The position taken by the
two great leaders, and held by them substantially intact,
was a variant of neo-Hegelianism, as has been indicated
in an earlier section of this paper.[5] But neo-Hegelianism
was short-lived, particularly considered as a standpoint
for scientific theory. The whole romantic school of
thought, comprising neo-Hegelianism with the rest, began
to go to pieces very soon after it had reached an approach
to maturity, and its disintegration proceeded with exceptional
speed, so that the close of the third quarter of the
century saw the virtual end of it as a vital factor in the

to an invariability of position, in Marx's writing, from
the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> to the last volume of the <i>Capital</i>.
The only portion of the great <i>Manifesto</i> which became antiquated,
in the apprehension of its creators, is the polemics addressed to
the "Philosophical" socialists of the forties and the illustrative
material taken from contemporary politics. The main position
and the more important articles of theory--the materialistic conception,
the doctrine of class struggle, the theory of value and
surplus value, of increasing distress, of the reserve army, of the
capitalistic collapse--are to be found in the <i>Critique of Political
Economy</i> (1859), and much of them in the <i>Misery of Philosophy</i>
(1847), together with the masterful method of analysis and construction
which he employed throughout his theoretical work.]

development of human knowledge. In the realm of
theory, primarily of course in the material sciences, the
new era belongs not to romantic philosophy, but to the
evolutionists of the school of Darwin. Some few great
figures, of course, stood over from the earlier days, but
it turns out in the sequel that they have served mainly to
mark the rate and degree in which the method of scientific
knowledge has left them behind. Such were Virchow
and Max M√ºller, and such, in economic science, were the
great figures of the Historical School, and such, in a degree,
were also Marx and Engels. The later generation
of socialists, the spokesmen and adherents of Marxism
during the closing quarter of the century, belong to the
new generation, and see the phenomena of human life
under the new light. The materialistic conception in
their handling of it takes on the color of the time in which
they lived, even while they retain the phraseology of the
generation that went before them.[6]

The difference between the romantic school of thought,
to which Marx belonged, and the school of the evolution-*

[Footnote 6: Such a socialist as Anton Menger, <i>e.g.</i>, comes into the neo-Marxian
school from without, from the field of modern scientific
inquiry, and shows, at least virtually, no Hegelian color, whether
in the scope of his inquiry, in his method, or in the theoretical
work which he puts forth. It should be added that his <i>Neue
Staatslehre</i>, and <i>Neue Sittenlehre</i> are the first socialistic constructive
work of substantial value as a contribution to knowledge,
outside of economic theory proper, that has appeared since
Lassalle. The efforts of Engels (<i>Ursprung der Familie</i>) and
Bebel (<i>Die Frau</i>) would scarcely be taken seriously as scientific
monographs even by hot-headed socialists if it were not for the
lack of anything better. Menger's work is not Marxism, whereas
Engels's and Bebel's work of this class is practically without
value or originality. The unfitness of the Marxian postulates and
methods for the purposes of modern science shows itself in the
sweeping barrenness of socialistic literature all along that line
of inquiry into the evolution of institutions for the promotion of
which the materialistic dialectic was invented.]

*ists into whose hands the system has fallen,--or perhaps,
better, is falling,--is great and pervading, though it may
not show a staring superficial difference at any one point,--at
least not yet. The discrepancy between the two is
likely to appear more palpable and more sweeping when
the new method of knowledge has been applied with fuller
realisation of its reach and its requirement in that domain
of knowledge that once belonged to the neo-Hegelian
Marxism. The supplanting of the one by the other has
been taking place slowly, gently, in large measure unavowedly,
by a sort of precession of the point of view
from which men size up the facts and reduce them to
intelligible order.

The neo-Hegelian, romantic, Marxian standpoint was
wholly personal, whereas the evolutionistic--it may be
called Darwinian--standpoint is wholly impersonal.
The continuity sought in the facts of observation and
imputed to them by the earlier school of theory was a
continuity of a personal kind,--a continuity of reason and
consequently of logic. The facts were construed to take
such a course as could be established by an appeal to reason
between intelligent and fair-minded men. They were
supposed to fall into a sequence of logical consistency.
The romantic (Marxian) sequence of theory is essentially
an intellectual sequence, and it is therefore of a teleological
character. The logical trend of it can be argued out.
That is to say, it tends to a goal. On the other hand, in
the Darwinian scheme of thought, the continuity sought in
and imputed to the facts is a continuity of cause and
effect. It is a scheme of blindly cumulative causation,
in which there is no trend, no final term, no consummation.
The sequence is controlled by nothing but the <i>vis
a tergo</i> of brute causation, and is essentially mechanical.
The neo-Hegelian (Marxian) scheme of development is
-----File: 445.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\johnbtarzan\JackieB\Hermit00\----------
drawn in the image of the struggling ambitious human
spirit: that of Darwinian evolution is of the nature of a
mechanical process.[7]

What difference, now, does it make if the materialistic
conception is translated from the romantic concepts of
Marx into the mechanical concepts of Darwinism? It
distorts every feature of the system in some degree, and
throws a shadow of doubt on every conclusion that once
seemed secure.[8] The first principle of the Marxian
scheme is the concept covered by the term "Materialistic,"
to the effect that the exigencies of the material means of
life control the conduct of men in society throughout, and
thereby indefeasibly guide the growth of institutions and
shape every shifting trait of human culture. This control
of the life of society by the material exigencies takes
effect through men's taking thought of material (economic)
advantages and disadvantages, and choosing that
which will yield the fuller material measure of life.
When the materialistic conception passes under the Dar-*

[Footnote 7: This contrast holds between the original Marxism of Marx
and the scope and method of modern science; but it does not,
therefore, hold between the latter-day Marxists--who are largely
imbued with post-Darwinian concepts--and the non-Marxian
scientists. Even Engels, in his latter-day formulation of Marxism,
is strongly affected with the notions of post-Darwinian
science, and reads Darwinism into Hegel and Marx with a good
deal of <i>na√Øvet√©</i>. (See his <i>Feuerbach</i>, especially pp. 93-98 of the
English translation.) So, also, the serious but scarcely quite
consistent qualifications of the materialistic conception offered by
Engels in the letters printed in the <i>Sozialistische Akademiker</i>,
1895.]

[Footnote 8: The fact that the theoretical structures of Marx collapse when
their elements are converted into the terms of modern science
should of itself be sufficient proof that those structures were
not built by their maker out of such elements as modern science
habitually makes use of. Marx was neither ignorant, imbecile,
nor disingenuous, and his work must be construed from such a
point of view and in terms of such elements as will enable his
results to stand substantially sound and convincing.]

*winian norm, of cumulative causation, it happens, first,
that this initial principle itself is reduced to the rank of
a habit of thought induced in the speculator who depends
on its light, by the circumstances of his life, in the way of
hereditary bent, occupation, tradition, education, climate,
food supply, and the like. But under the Darwinian
norm the question of whether and how far material exigencies
control human conduct and cultural growth becomes
a question of the share which these material exigencies
have in shaping men's habits of thought, <i>i.e.</i>, their
ideals and aspirations, their sense of the true, the beautiful,
and the good. Whether and how far these traits of
human culture and the institutional structure built out of
them are the outgrowth of material (economic) exigencies
becomes a question of what kind and degree of efficiency
belongs to the economic exigencies among the complex
of circumstances that conduce to the formation of
habits. It is no longer a question of whether material
exigencies rationally should guide men's conduct, but
whether, as a matter of brute causation, they do induce
such habits of thought in men as the economic interpretation
presumes, and whether in the last analysis economic
exigencies alone are, directly or indirectly, effective in
shaping human habits of thought.

Tentatively and by way of approximation some such
formulation as that outlined in the last paragraph is apparently
what Bernstein and others of the "revisionists"
have been seeking in certain of their speculations,[9] and,

[Footnote 9: Cf.[**"Cf." usually italicised] <i>Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus</i>, especially the first two
(critical) chapters. Bernstein's reverent attitude toward Marx
and Engels, as well as his somewhat old-fashioned conception of
the scope and method of science, gives his discussion an air
of much greater consonance with the orthodox Marxism than
it really has. In his later expressions this consonance and
conciliatory animus show up more strongly rather than other-*]*
-----File: 447.png---\Pitirim\plappen\Lis\jander10\Hermit00\---------------
sitting austere and sufficient on a dry shoal up stream,
Kautsky has uncomprehendingly been addressing them
advice and admonition which they do not understand.[10]
The more intelligent and enterprising among the idealist
wing--where intellectual enterprise is not a particularly
obvious trait--have been struggling to speak for the
view that the forces of the environment may effectually
reach men's spiritual life through other avenues than the

*[Footnote: *wise. (See <i>Socialism and Science</i>, including the special preface
written for the French edition.) That which was to Marx
and Engels the point of departure and the guiding norm--the
Hegelian dialectic--is to Bernstein a mistake from which scientific
socialism must free itself. He says, <i>e.g.</i> (<i>Voraussetzungen</i>,
end of ch. iv.), "The great things achieved by Marx and Engels
they have achieved not by the help of the Hegelian dialectic, but
in spite of it."

The number of the "revisionists" is very considerable, and
they are plainly gaining ground as against the Marxists of the
older line of orthodoxy. They are by no means agreed among
themselves as to details, but they belong together by virtue of
their endeavor to so construe (and amend) the Marxian system
as to bring it into consonance with the current scientific point
of view. One should rather say points of view, since the revisionists'
endeavors are not all directed to bringing the received
views in under a single point of view. There are two
main directions of movement among the revisionists: (<i>a</i>) those
who, like Bernstein, Conrad Schmidt, Tugan-Baranowski, Labriola,
Ferri, aim to bring Marxism abreast of the standpoint of
modern science, essentially Darwinists; and (<i>b</i>) those who aim
to return to some footing on the level of the romantic philosophy.
The best type and the strongest of the latter class are the neo-Kantians,
embodying that spirit of revulsion to romantic norms
of theory that makes up the philosophical side of the reactionary
movement fostered by the discipline of German imperialism.
(See K. Vorl√§nder, <i>Die neukantische Bewegung im Sozialismus</i>.)

Except that he is not officially inscribed in the socialist calendar,
Sombart might be cited as a particularly effective revisionist,
so far as concerns the point of modernising Marxism
and putting the modernised materialistic conception to work.]

calculus of the main chance, and so may give rise to
habitual ideals and aspirations independent of, and possibly
alien to, that calculus.[11]

So, again, as to the doctrine of the class struggle. In
the Marxian scheme of dialectical evolution the development
which is in this way held to be controlled by the
material exigencies must, it is held, proceed by the method
of the class struggle. This class struggle is held to be
inevitable, and is held inevitably to lead at each revolutionary
epoch to a more efficient adjustment of human
industry to human uses, because, when a large proportion
of the community find themselves ill served by the current
economic arrangements, they take thought, band together,
and enforce a readjustment more equitable and more advantageous
to them. So long as differences of economic
advantage prevail, there will be a divergence of interests
between those more advantageously placed and those less
advantageously placed. The members of society will
take sides as this line of cleavage indicated by their several
economic interests may decide. Class solidarity will
arise on the basis of this class interest, and a struggle between
the two classes so marked off against each other
will set in,--a struggle which, in the logic of the situation,
can end only when the previously less fortunate class

[Footnote 11: The "idealist" socialists are even more in evidence outside
of Germany. They may fairly be said to be in the ascendant in
France, and they are a very strong and free-spoken contingent
of the socialist movement in America. They do not commonly
speak the language either of science or of philosophy, but, so far
as their contentions may be construed from the standpoint of
modern science, their drift seems to be something of the kind
indicated above. At the same time the spokesmen of this scattering
and shifting group stand for a variety of opinions and
aspirations that cannot be classified under Marxism, Darwinism,
or any other system of theory. At the margin they shade off into
theology and the creeds.]
-----File: 449.png---\Pitirim\plappen\Lis\JackieB\Hermit00\----------------
gains the ascendancy,--and so must the class struggle
proceed until it shall have put an end to that diversity of
economic interest on which the class struggle rests. All
this is logically consistent and convincing, but it proceeds
on the ground of reasoned conduct, calculus of advantage,
not on the ground of cause and effect. The class struggle
so conceived should always and everywhere tend unremittingly
toward the socialistic consummation, and should
reach that consummation in the end, whatever obstructions
or diversions might retard the sequence of development
along the way. Such is the notion of it embodied
in the system of Marx. Such, however, is not the showing
of history. Not all nations or civilisations have advanced
unremittingly toward a socialistic consummation,
in which all divergence of economic interest has lapsed
or would lapse. Those nations and civilisations which
have decayed and failed, as nearly all known nations and
civilisations have done, illustrate the point that, however
reasonable and logical the advance by means of the class
struggle may be, it is by no means inevitable. Under the
Darwinian norm it must be held that men's reasoning is
largely controlled by other than logical, intellectual
forces; that the conclusion reached by public or class
opinion is as much, or more, a matter of sentiment than
of logical inference; and that the sentiment which animates
men, singly or collectively, is as much, or more, an
outcome of habit and native propensity as of calculated
material interest. There is, for instance, no warrant in
the Darwinian scheme of things for asserting <i>a priori</i> that
the class interest of the working class will bring them to
take a stand against the propertied class. It may as well
be that their training in subservience to their employers
will bring them again to realise the equity and excellence
of the established system of subjection and unequal dis-*
-----File: 450.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
*tribution of wealth. Again, no one, for instance, can tell
to-day what will be the outcome of the present situation
in Europe and America. It may be that the working
classes will go forward along the line of the socialistic
ideals and enforce a new deal, in which there shall be no
economic class discrepancies, no international animosity,
no dynastic politics. But then it may also, so far as can
be foreseen, equally well happen that the working class,
with the rest of the community in Germany, England, or
America, will be led by the habit of loyalty and by their
sportsmanlike propensities to lend themselves enthusiastically
to the game of dynastic politics, which alone their
sportsmanlike rulers consider worth while. It is quite
impossible on Darwinian ground to foretell whether the
"proletariat" will go on to establish the socialistic revolution
or turn aside again, and sink their force in the
broad sands of patriotism. It is a question of habit and
native propensity and of the range of stimuli to which the
proletariat are exposed and are to be exposed, and what
may be the outcome is not a matter of logical consistency,
but of response to stimulus.

So, then, since Darwinian concepts have begun to dominate
the thinking of the Marxists, doubts have now and
again come to assert themselves both as to the inevitableness
of the irrepressible class struggle and to its sole efficacy.
Anything like a violent class struggle, a seizure
of power by force, is more and more consistently deprecated.
For resort to force, it is felt, brings in its train
coercive control with all its apparatus of prerogative, mastery,
and subservience.[12]

[Footnote 12: Throughout the revisionist literature in Germany there is a
visible softening of the traits of the doctrine of the class struggle,
and the like shows itself in the programmes of the party.
Outside of Germany the doctrinaire insistence on this tenet is]*
-----File: 451.png---\Pitirim\plappen\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\---------

So, again, the Marxian doctrine of progressive proletarian
distress, the so-called <i>Verelendungstheorie</i>, which
stands pat on the romantic ground of the original Marxism,
has fallen into abeyance, if not into disrepute, since
the Darwinian conceptions have come to prevail. As a
matter of reasoned procedure, on the ground of enlightened
material interest alone, it should be a tenable position
that increasing misery, increasing in degree and in
volume, should be the outcome of the present system of
ownership, and should at the same time result in a well-advised
and well-consolidated working-class movement
that would replace the present system by a scheme more
advantageous to the majority. But so soon as the question
is approached on the Darwinian ground of cause and
effect, and is analysed in terms of habit and of response
to stimulus, the doctrine that progressive misery must
effect a socialistic revolution becomes dubious, and very
shortly untenable. Experience, the experience of history,
teaches that abject misery carries with it deterioration
and abject subjection. The theory of progressive
distress fits convincingly into the scheme of the Hegelian
three-phase dialectic. It stands for the antithesis that is
to be merged in the ulterior synthesis; but it has no particular
force on the ground of an argument from cause
to effect.[13]

It fares not much better with the Marxian theory of
value and its corollaries and dependent doctrines when

*[Footnote: weakening even more decidedly. The opportunist politicians,
with strong aspirations, but with relatively few and ill-defined
theoretical preconceptions, are gaining ground.]

und soziale Bewegung</i>, 5th edition, pp. 86-89.]
-----File: 452.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
Darwinian concepts are brought in to replace the romantic
elements out of which it is built up. Its foundation
is the metaphysical equality between the volume of
human life force productively spent in the making of
goods and the magnitude of these goods considered as
human products. The question of such an equality has
no meaning in terms of cause and effect, nor does it bear
in any intelligible way upon the Darwinian question of
the fitness of any given system of production or distribution.
In any evolutionary system of economics the
central question touching the efficiency and fitness of any
given system of production is necessarily the question as
to the excess of serviceability in the product over the
cost of production.[14] It is in such an excess of serviceability
over cost that the chance of survival lies for any
system of production, in so far as the question of survival
is a question of production, and this matter comes into
the speculation of Marx only indirectly or incidentally,
and leads to nothing in his argument.

And, as bearing on the Marxian doctrines of exploitation,
there is on Darwinian ground no place for a natural
right to the full product of labor. What can be argued
in that connection on the ground of cause and effect simply
is the question as to what scheme of distribution will

[Footnote 14: Accordingly, in later Marxian handling of the questions of
exploitation and accumulation, the attention is centered on the
"surplus product" rather than on the "surplus value." It is
also currently held that the doctrines and practical consequences
which Marx derived from the theory of surplus value would
remain substantially well founded, even if the theory of surplus
value was given up. These secondary doctrines could be saved--at
the cost of orthodoxy--by putting a theory of surplus
product in the place of the theory of surplus value, as in effect
is done by Bernstein (<i>Socialdemokratie in Theorie und Praxis</i>,
sec. 5. Also various of the essays included in <i>Zur Geschichte und
Theorie des Sozialismus</i>).]
-----File: 453.png---\Pitirim\plappen\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
help or hinder the survival of a given people or a given
civilisation.[15]

But these questions of abstruse theory need not be
pursued, since they count, after all, but relatively little
among the working tenets of the movement. Little need
be done by the Marxists to work out or to adapt the
Marxian system of value theory, since it has but slight
bearing on the main question,--the question of the trend
towards socialism and of its chances of success. It is conceivable
that a competent theory of value dealing with
the excess of serviceability over cost, on the one hand,
and with the discrepancy between price and serviceability,
on the other hand, would have a substantial bearing upon
the advisability of the present as against the socialistic
r√©gime, and would go far to clear up the notions of both
socialists and conservatives as to the nature of the points
in dispute between them. But the socialists have not
moved in the direction of this problem, and they have the
excuse that their critics have suggested neither a question
nor a solution to a question along any such line. None
of the value theorists have so far offered anything that
could be called good, bad, or indifferent in this connection,
and the socialists are as innocent as the rest. Economics,
indeed, has not at this point yet begun to take on a modern
tone, unless the current neglect of value theory by
the socialists be taken as a negative symptom of advance,
indicating that they at least recognise the futility of the

[Footnote 15: The "right to the full product of labor" and the Marxian
theory of exploitation associated with that principle has fallen
into the background, except as a campaign cry designed to stir
the emotions of the working class. Even as a campaign cry it
has not the prominence, nor apparently the efficacy, which it once
had. The tenet is better preserved, in fact, among the "idealists",
who draw for their antecedents on the French Revolution
and the English philosophy of natural rights, than among the
latter-day Marxists.]
-----File: 454.png---\Pitirim\plappen\mdmcdaniel\jander10\Hermit00\--------
received problems and solutions, even if they are not ready
to make a positive move.

<tb>

The shifting of the current point of view, from romantic
philosophy to matter-of-fact, has affected the attitude
of the Marxists towards the several articles of theory
more than it has induced an avowed alteration or a substitution
of new elements of theory for the old. It is always
possible to make one's peace with a new standpoint
by new interpretations and a shrewd use of figures of
speech, so far as the theoretical formulation is concerned,
and something of this kind has taken place in the case
of Marxism; but when, as in the case of Marxism, the
formulations of theory are drafted into practical use, substantial
changes of appreciable magnitude are apt to show
themselves in a changed attitude towards practical questions.
The Marxists have had to face certain practical
problems, especially problems of party tactics, and the
substantial changes wrought in their theoretical outlook
have come into evidence here. The real gravity of the
changes that have overtaken Marxism would scarcely be
seen by a scrutiny of the formal professions of the Marxists
alone. But the exigencies of a changing situation
have provoked readjustments of the received doctrinal
position, and the shifting of the philosophical standpoint
and postulates has come into evidence as marking the
limits of change in their professions which the socialistic
doctrinaires could allow themselves.

The changes comprised in the cultural movement that
lies between the middle and the close of the nineteenth
century are great and grave, at least as seen from so near
a standpoint as the present day, and it is safe to say that,
in whatever historical perspective they may be seen, they
must, in some respects, always assert themselves as un-*
-----File: 455.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\LouiseP\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
*precedented. So far as concerns the present topic, there
are three main lines of change that have converged upon
the Marxist system of doctrines, and have led to its
latter-day modification and growth. One of these--the
change in the postulates of knowledge, in the metaphysical
foundations of theory--has been spoken of already,
and its bearing on the growth of socialist theory
has been indicated in certain of its general features.
But, among the circumstances that have conditioned the
growth of the system, the most obvious is the fact that
since Marx's time his doctrines have come to serve as
the platform of a political movement, and so have been
exposed to the stress of practical party politics dealing
with a new and changing situation. At the same time
the industrial (economic) situation to which the doctrines
are held to apply--of which they are the theoretical
formulation--has also in important respects
changed its character from what it was when Marx first
formulated his views. These several lines of cultural
change affecting the growth of Marxism cannot be held
apart in so distinct a manner as to appraise the work of
each separately. They belong inextricably together, as
do the effects wrought by them in the system.

In practical politics the Social Democrats have had to
make up their account with the labor movement, the
agricultural population, and the imperialistic policy. On
each of these heads the preconceived programme of
Marxism has come in conflict with the run of events, and
on each head it has been necessary to deal shrewdly and
adapt the principles to the facts of the time. The adaptation
to circumstances has not been altogether of the
nature of compromise, although here and there the spirit
of compromise and conciliation is visible enough. A
conciliatory party policy may, of course, impose an
-----File: 456.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\LouiseP\jander10\Hermit00\-------------
adaptation of form and color upon the party principles,
without thereby seriously affecting the substance of the
principles themselves; but the need of a conciliatory policy
may, even more, provoke a substantial change of attitude
toward practical questions in a case where a shifting
of the theoretical point of view makes room for a
substantial change.

Apart from all merely tactical expedients, the experience
of the past thirty years has led the German Marxists
to see the facts of the labor situation in a new light, and
has induced them to attach an altered meaning to the
accepted formulations of doctrine. The facts have not
freely lent themselves to the scheme of the Marxist system,
but the scheme has taken on such a new meaning as
would be consistent with the facts. The untroubled
Marxian economics, such as it finds expression in the
<i>Kapital</i> and earlier documents of the theory, has no place
and no use for a trade-union movement, or, indeed, for
any similar non-political organisation among the working
class, and the attitude of the Social-Democratic leaders
of opinion in the early days of the party's history was
accordingly hostile to any such movement,[16]--as much
so, indeed, as the loyal adherents of the classical political
economy. That was before the modern industrial era

[Footnote 16: It is, of course, well known that even in the transactions
and pronounciamentos of the International a good word is repeatedly
said for the trade-unions, and both the Gotha and the
Erfurt programmes speak in favor of labor organisations, and
put forth demands designed to further the trade-union endeavors.
But it is equally well known that these expressions were in good
part perfunctory, and that the substantial motive behind them
was the politic wish of the socialists to conciliate the unionists,
and make use of the unions for the propaganda. The early
expressions of sympathy with the unionist cause were made
for an ulterior purpose. Later on, in the nineties, there comes
a change in the attitude of the socialist leaders toward the
unions.]
-----File: 457.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
had got under way in Germany, and therefore before the
German socialistic doctrinaires had learned by experience
what the development of industry was to bring with
it. It was also before the modern scientific postulates had
begun to disintegrate the neo-Hegelian preconceptions as
to the logical sequence in the development of institutions.

In Germany, as elsewhere, the growth of the capitalistic
system presently brought on trade-unionism; that is to
say, it brought on an organised attempt on the part of
the workmen to deal with the questions of capitalistic
production and distribution by business methods, to settle
the problems of working-class employment and livelihood
by a system of non-political, businesslike bargains. But
the great point of all socialist aspiration and endeavor
is the abolition of all business and all bargaining, and,
accordingly, the Social Democrats were heartily out of
sympathy with the unions and their endeavors to make
business terms with the capitalist system, and make life
tolerable for the workmen under that system. But the
union movement grew to be so serious a feature of the
situation that the socialists found themselves obliged to
deal with unions, since they could not deal with the
workmen over the heads of the unions. The Social Democrats,
and therefore the Marxian theorists, had to deal
with a situation which included the union movement, and
this movement was bent on improving the workman's
conditions of life from day to day. Therefore it was
necessary to figure out how the union movement could
and must further the socialistic advance; to work into the
body of doctrines a theory of how the unions belong in
the course of economic development that leads up to socialism,
and to reconcile the unionist efforts at improvement
with the ends of Social Democracy. Not only were
the unions seeking improvement by unsocialistic methods,
-----File: 458.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
but the level of comfort among the working classes was
in some respects advancing, apparently as a result of these
union efforts. Both the huckstering animus of the workmen
in their unionist policy and the possible amelioration
of working-class conditions had to be incorporated into
the socialistic platform and into the Marxist theory of
economic development. The Marxist theory of progressive
misery and degradation has, accordingly, fallen into
the background, and a large proportion of the Marxists
have already come to see the whole question of working-class
deterioration in some such apologetic light as is shed
upon it by Goldscheid in his <i>Verelendungs-oder Meliorationstheorie</i>.
It is now not an unusual thing for orthodox
Marxists to hold that the improvement of the conditions
of the working classes is a necessary condition to the
advance of the socialistic cause, and that the unionist
efforts at amelioration must be furthered as a means toward
the socialistic consummation. It is recognised that
the socialistic revolution must be carried through not by
an an√¶mic working class under the pressure of abject
privation, but by a body of full-blooded workingmen
gradually gaining strength from improved conditions of
life. Instead of the revolution being worked out by the
leverage of desperate misery, every improvement in working-class
conditions is to be counted as a gain for the
revolutionary forces. This is a good Darwinism, but it
does not belong in the neo-Hegelian Marxism.

Perhaps the sorest experience of the Marxist doctrinaires
has been with the agricultural population. Notoriously,
the people of the open country have not taken
kindly to socialism. No propaganda and no changes in
the economic situation have won the sympathy of the
peasant farmers for the socialistic revolution. Notoriously,
too, the large-scale industry has not invaded the
-----File: 459.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
agricultural field, or expropriated the small proprietors,
in anything like the degree expected by the Marxist doctrinaires
of a generation ago. It is contained in the theoretical
system of Marx that, as modern industrial and
business methods gain ground, the small proprietor farmers
will be reduced to the ranks of the wage-proletariat,
and that, as this process of conversion goes on, in the
course of time the class interest of the agricultural population
will throw them into the movement side by side
with the other wage-workmen.[17] But at this point the
facts have hitherto not come out in consonance with the
Marxist theory. And the efforts of the Social Democrats
to convert the peasant population to socialism have been
practically unrewarded. So it has come about that the
political leaders and the keepers of the doctrines have,
tardily and reluctantly, come to see the facts of the agrarian
situation in a new light, and to give a new phrasing
to the articles of Marxian theory that touch on the fortunes
of the peasant farmer. It is no longer held that
either the small properties of the peasant farmer must
be absorbed into larger properties, and then taken over
by the State, or that they must be taken over by the State
directly, when the socialistic revolution is established.
On the contrary, it is now coming to be held that the
peasant proprietors will not be disturbed in their holdings
by the great change. The great change is to deal
with capitalistic enterprise, and the peasant farming is
not properly "capitalistic." It is a system of production
in which the producer normally gets only the product
of his own labor. Indeed, under the current r√©gime of
markets and credit relations, the small agricultural producer,
it is held, gets less than the product of his own
labor, since the capitalistic business enterprises with which

[Footnote 17: <i>Cf.</i> <i>Kapital</i>, vol. i, ch. xiii, sect 10.]
-----File: 460.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\jander10\Hermit00\-----------------
he has to deal are always able to take advantage of him.
So it has become part of the overt doctrine of socialists
that as regards the peasant farmer it will be the consistent
aim of the movement to secure him in the untroubled enjoyment
of his holding, and free him from the vexatious
exactions of his creditors and the ruinous business traffic
in which he is now perforce involved. According to the
revised code, made possible by recourse to Darwinian
concepts of evolution instead of the Hegelian three-phase
dialectic, therefore, and contrary to the earlier prognostications
of Marx, it is no longer held that agricultural industry
must go through the capitalistic mill; and it is
hoped that under the revised code it may be possible to
enlist the interest and sympathy of this obstinately conservative
element for the revolutionary cause. The
change in the official socialist position on the agricultural
question has come about only lately, and is scarcely yet
complete, and there is no knowing what degree of success
it may meet with either as a matter of party tactics or as
a feature of the socialistic theory of economic development.
All discussions of party policy, and of theory so
far as bears on policy, take up the question; and nearly
all authoritative spokesmen of socialism have modified
their views in the course of time on this point.

The socialism of Karl Marx is characteristically inclined
to peaceable measures and disinclined to a coercive
government and belligerent politics. It is, or at least it
was, strongly averse to international jealousy and patriotic
animosity, and has taken a stand against armaments,
wars, and dynastic aggrandisement. At the time
of the French-Prussian war the official organisation of
Marxism, the International, went so far in its advocacy
of peace as to urge the soldiery on both sides to refuse
to fight. After the campaign had warmed the blood of
-----File: 461.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\gst\JackieB\Hermit00\------------------
the two nations, this advocacy of peace made the International
odious in the eyes of both French and Germans.
War begets patriotism, and the socialists fell under the
reproach of not being sufficiently patriotic. After the
conclusion of the war the Socialistic Workingmen's Party
of Germany sinned against the German patriotic sentiment
in a similar way and with similarly grave results.
Since the foundation of the empire and of the Social-Democratic
party, the socialists and their doctrines have
passed through a further experience of a similar kind,
but on a larger scale and more protracted. The government
has gradually strengthened its autocratic position
at home, increased its warlike equipment, and enlarged
its pretensions in international politics, until what would
have seemed absurdly impossible a generation ago is now
submitted to by the German people, not only with a good
grace, but with enthusiasm. During all this time that
part of the population that has adhered to the socialist
ideals has also grown gradually more patriotic and more
loyal, and the leaders and keepers of socialist opinion
have shared in the growth of chauvinism with the rest of
the German people. But at no time have the socialists
been able to keep abreast of the general upward movement
in this respect. They have not attained the pitch of reckless
loyalty that animates the conservative German patriots,
although it is probably safe to say that the Social
Democrats of to-day are as good and headlong patriots
as the conservative Germans were a generation ago.
During all this period of the new era of German political
life the socialists have been freely accused of disloyalty
to the national ambition, of placing their international
aspirations above the ambition of imperial aggrandisement.

The socialist spokesmen have been continually on the
-----File: 462.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\tenorcnj\jander10\Hermit00\------------
defensive. They set out with a round opposition to any
considerable military establishment, and have more and
more apologetically continued to oppose any "undue"
extension of the warlike establishments and the warlike
policy. But with the passage of time and the habituation
to warlike politics and military discipline, the infection
of jingoism has gradually permeated the body of
Social Democrats, until they have now reached such a
pitch of enthusiastic loyalty as they would not patiently
hear a truthful characterisation of. The spokesmen now
are concerned to show that, while they still stand for
international socialism, consonant with their ancient position,
they stand for national aggrandisement first and
for international comity second. The relative importance
of the national and the international ideals in German
socialist professions has been reversed since the seventies.[18]
The leaders are busy with interpretation of their
earlier formulations. They have come to excite themselves
over nebulous distinctions between patriotism and
jingoism. The Social Democrats have come to be German
patriots first and socialists second, which comes to
saying that they are a political party working for the
maintenance of the existing order, with modifications.
They are no longer a party of revolution, but of reform,
though the measure of reform which they demand greatly
exceeds the Hohenzollern limit of tolerance. They are
now as much, if not more, in touch with the ideas of English
liberalism than with those of revolutionary Marxism.

The material and tactical exigencies that have grown
out of changes in the industrial system and in the political
situation, then, have brought on far-reaching changes of

[Footnote 18: <i>Cf.</i> Kautsky, <i>Erfurter Programm</i>, ch. v, sect. 13; Bernstein,
<i>Voraussetzungen</i>, ch. iv, sect. e.]
-----File: 463.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
adaptation in the position of the socialists. The change
may not be extremely large at any one point, so far as
regards the specific articles of the programme, but, taken
as a whole, the resulting modification of the socialistic
position is a very substantial one. The process of change
is, of course, not yet completed,--whether or not it ever
will be,--but it is already evident that what is taking
place is not so much a change in amount or degree of
conviction on certain given points as a change in kind,--a
change in the current socialistic habit of mind.

The factional discrepancies of theory that have occupied
the socialists of Germany for some years past are
evidence that the conclusion, even a provisional conclusion,
of the shifting of their standpoint has not been
reached. It is even hazardous to guess which way the
drift is setting. It is only evident that the past standpoint,
the standpoint of neo-Hegelian Marxism, cannot
be regained,--it is a forgotten standpoint. For the immediate
present the drift of sentiment, at least among the
educated, seems to set toward a position resembling that
of the National Socials and the Rev. Mr. Naumann;
that is to say, imperialistic liberalism. Should the conditions,
political, social, and economic, which to-day are
chiefly effective in shaping the habits of thought among
the German people, continue substantially unchanged and
continue to be the chief determining causes, it need surprise
no one to find German socialism gradually changing
into a somewhat characterless imperialistic democracy.
The imperial policy seems in a fair way to get
the better of revolutionary socialism, not by repressing
it, but by force of the discipline in imperialistic ways of
thinking to which it subjects all classes of the population.
How far a similar process of sterilisation is under way,
-----File: 464.png---\Pitirim\Mosom\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
or is likely to overtake the socialist movement in other
countries, is an obscure question to which the German
object-lesson affords no certain answer.

THE MUTATION THEORY AND THE BLOND
RACE[1]


The theories of racial development by mutation, associated
with the name of Mendel, when they come to be
freely applied to man, must greatly change the complexion
of many currently debated questions of race--as
to origins, migrations, dispersion, chronology, cultural
derivation and sequence. In some respects the new
theories should simplify current problems of ethnology,
and they may even dispense with many analyses and speculations
that have seemed of great moment in the past.

The main postulate of the Mendelian theories--the
stability of type--has already done much service in anthropological
science, being commonly assumed as a matter
of course in arguments dealing with the derivation
and dispersion of races and peoples. It is only by force
of this assumption that ethnologists are able to identify
any given racial stock over intervals of space or time, and
so to trace the racial affinities of any given people.
Question has been entertained from time to time as to the
racial fixity of given physical traits--as, <i>e.g.</i>, stature,
the cephalic indices, or hair and eye color--but on the
whole these and other standard marks of race are still
accepted as secure grounds of identification.[2] Indeed,
without some such assumption any ethnological inquiry
must degenerate into mere wool-gathering.

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Journal of Race Development</i>,
Vol. III, No. 4.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Cf.</i>, however, W. Ridgeway, "The Application of Zo√∂logical
Laws to Man," <i>Report, British Association for Advancement of
Science</i> (Dublin), 1908.]
-----File: 466.png---\mjstar5\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------

But along with this, essentially Mendelian, postulate of
the stability of types, ethnologists have at the same time
habitually accepted the incompatible Darwinian doctrine
that racial types vary incontinently after a progressive
fashion, arising through insensible cumulative variations
and passing into new specific forms by the same method,
under the Darwinian rule of the selective survival of slight
and unstable (non-typical) variations. The effect of
these two incongruous premises has been to leave discussions
of race derivation somewhat at loose ends wherever
the two postulates cross one another.

If it be assumed, or granted, that racial types are stable,
it follows as a matter of course that these types or races
have not arisen by the cumulative acquirement of unstable
non-specific traits, but must have originated by
mutation or by some analogous method, and this view
must then find its way into anthropology as into the
other biological sciences. When such a step is taken an
extensive revision of questions of race will be unavoidable,
and an appreciable divergence may then be looked
for among speculations on the mutational affinities of the
several races and cultures.

Among matters so awaiting revision are certain broad
questions of derivation and ethnography touching the
blond race or races of Europe. Much attention, and indeed
much sentiment, has been spent on this general
topic. The questions involved are many and diverse,
and many of them have been subject of animated controversy,
without definitive conclusions.

The mutation theories, of course, have immediately to
do with the facts of biological derivation alone, but when
the facts are reviewed in the light of these theories it will
be found that questions of cultural origins and relationship
are necessarily drawn into the inquiry. In particu-*
-----File: 467.png---\tigerswim\BabsP\mdmcdaniel\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
*lar, an inquiry into the derivation and distribution of the
blond stock will so intimately involve questions of the
Aryan speech and institutions as to be left incomplete
without a somewhat detailed attention to this latter range
of questions. So much so that an inquiry into the advent
and early fortunes of the blond stock in Europe will fall,
by convenience, under two distinct but closely related
captions: The Origin of the Blond Type, and The
Derivation of the Aryan Culture.

/#
(a) It is held, on the one hand, that there is but a single
blond race, type or stock (Keane, Lapouge, Sergi),
and on the other hand that there are several such races
or types, more or less distinct but presumably related
(Deniker, Beddoe, and other, especially British, ethnologists).
(b) There is no good body of evidence going
to establish a great antiquity for the blond stock, and
there are indications, though perhaps inconclusive, that
the blond strain, including all the blond types, is of relatively
late date--unless a Berber (Kabyle) blond race
is to be accepted in a more unequivocal manner than
hitherto. (c) Neither is there anything like convincing
evidence that this blond strain has come from outside of
Europe--except, again, for the equivocal Kabyle--or
that any blond race has ever been widely or permanently
distributed outside of its present European habitat, (d)
The blond race is not found unmixed. In point of pedigree
all individuals showing the blond traits are hybrids,
and the greater number of them show their mixed blood
in their physical traits. (e) There is no community,
large or small, made up exclusively of blonds, or nearly
so, and there is no good evidence available that such an
all-blond or virtually all-blond community ever has existed,
either in historic or prehistoric times. The race
#/
-----File: 468.png---\tigerswim\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\------------
/#
appears never to have lived in isolation. (f) It occurs in
several (perhaps hybrid) variants--unless these variants
are to be taken (with Deniker) as several distinct races,
(g) Counting the dolicho-blond as the original type of
the race, its nearest apparent relative among the races of
mankind is the Mediterranean (of Sergi), at least in point
of physical traits. At the same time the blond race, or at
least the dolicho-blond type, has never since neolithic
times, so far as known, extensively and permanently lived
in contact with the Mediterranean. (h) The various
(national) ramifications of the blond stock--or rather
the various racial mixtures into which an appreciable
blond element enters--are all, and to all appearance have
always been, of Aryan ("Indo-European," "Indo-Germanic")
speech--with the equivocal exception of the
Kabyle. (i) Yet far the greater number and variety
(national and linguistic) of men who use the Aryan
speech are not prevailingly blond, or even appreciably
mixed with blond. (j) The blond race, or the peoples
with an appreciable blond admixture, and particularly
the communities in which the dolicho-blond element prevails,
show little or none of the peculiarly Aryan institutions--understanding
by that phrase not the known institutions
of the ancient Germanic peoples, but that range of
institutions said by competent philologists to be reflected
in the primitive Aryan speech. (k) These considerations
raise the presumption that the blond race was not originally
of Aryan speech or of Aryan culture, and they also
suggest (l) that the Mediterranean, the nearest apparent
relative of the dolicho-blond, was likewise not originally
Aryan.
#/

Accepting the mutation theory, then, for the purpose in
hand, and leaving any questions of Aryanism on one side
-----File: 469.png---\tigerswim\BabsP\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
for the present, a canvass of the situation so outlined may
be offered in such bold, crude and summary terms as
should be admissible in an analysis which aims to be tentative
and provisional only. It may be conceived that the
dolichocephalic blond originated as a mutant of the Mediterranean
type (which it greatly resembles in its scheme
of biometric measurements[3]) probably some time after
that race had effected a permanent lodgment on the continent
of Europe. The Mediterranean stock may be held
(Sergi and Keane) to have come into Europe from
Africa,[4] whatever its remoter derivation may have been.
It is, of course, not impossible that the mutation which
gave rise to the dolicho-blond may have occurred before
the parent stock left Africa, or rather before it was shut
out of Africa by the submergence of the land connection
across Sicily, but the probabilities seem to be against such
a view. The conditions would appear to have been less
favorable to a mutation of this kind in the African habitat
of the parent stock than in Europe, and less favorable in
Europe during earlier quaternary time than toward the
close of the glacial period.

The causes which give rise to a variation of type have
always been sufficiently obscure, whether the origin of
species be conceived after the Darwinian or the Mendelian
fashion, and the mutation theories have hitherto afforded
little light on that question. Yet the Mendelian postulate
that the type is stable except for such a mutation as shall
establish a new type raises at least the presumption that
such a mutation will take place only under exceptional
circumstances, that is to stay[** typo for 'say'?], under circumstances so substantially
different from what the type is best adapted to
as to subject it to some degree of physiological strain. It

[Footnote 3: <i>Cf.</i> Sergi, <i>The Mediterranean Race</i>, ch. xi, xiii.]

[Footnote 4: Sergi, <i>Arii e Italici</i>; Keane, <i>Man Past and Present</i>, ch. xii.]
-----File: 470.png---\tigerswim\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Hermit00\-----------
is to be presumed that no mutation will supervene so long
as the conditions of life do not vary materially from what
they have been during the previous uneventful life-history
of the type. Such is the presumption apparently involved
in the theory and such is also the suggestion afforded by
the few experimental cases of observed mutation, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
those studied by De Vries.

A considerable climatic change, such as would seriously
alter the conditions of life either directly or through its
effect on the food supply, might be conceived to bring on a
mutating state in the race; or the like effect might be induced
by a profound cultural change, particularly any
such change in the industrial arts as would radically affect
the material conditions of life. These considerations,
mainly speculative it is true, suggest that the dolicho-blond
mutant could presumably have emerged only at a time
when the parent stock was exposed to notably novel conditions
of life, such as would be presumed (with De
Vries) to tend to throw the stock into a specifically unstable
(mutating) state; at the same time these novel conditions
of life must also have been specifically of such a
nature as to favor the survival and multiplication of this
particular human type. The climatic tolerance of the
dolicho-blond, <i>e.g.</i>, is known to be exceptionally narrow.
Now, it is not known, indeed there is no reason to presume,
that the Mediterranean race was exposed to such
variations of climate or of culture before it entered
Europe as might be expected to induce a mutating state
in the stock, and at the same time a mutant gifted with
the peculiar climatic intolerance of the dolicho-blond
would scarcely have survived under the conditions offered
by northern Africa in late quaternary time. But the required
conditions are had later on in Europe, after the
Mediterranean was securely at home in that continent.
-----File: 471.png---\tigerswim\taurustribe\VerenaM\jander10\Hermit00\-----

The whole episode may be conceived to have run off
somewhat in the following manner. The Mediterranean
race is held to have entered Europe in force during quaternary
time, presumably after the quaternary period was
well advanced, most likely during the last genial, interglacial
period. This race then brought the neolithic culture,
but without the domestic animals (or plants?) that
are a characteristic feature of the later neolithic age, and
it encountered at least the remnants of an older, palaeolithic
population. This older European population was
made up of several racial stocks, some of which still persist
as obscure and minor elements in the later peoples of
Europe. The (geologic) date to be assigned this intrusion
of the Mediterranean race into Europe is of course
not, and can perhaps never be, determined with any degree
of nicety or confidence. But there is a probability
that it coincides with the recession of the ice-sheet, following
one or another of the severer periods of glaciations,
that occurred before the submergence of the land
connection between Europe and Africa, over Gibraltar,
Sicily, and perhaps Crete. How late in quaternary time
the final submergence of the Mediterranean basin occurred
is still a matter of surmise; the intrusion of the Mediterranean
race into Europe appears, on archaeological evidence,
to have occurred in late quaternary time, and in
the end this archaeological evidence may help to decide the
geologic date of the severance of Europe from Africa.

The Mediterranean race seems to have spread easily
over the habitable surface of Europe and shortly to have
grown numerous and taken rank as the chief racial element
in the neolithic population; which argues that no
very considerable older population occupied the European
continent at the time of the Mediterranean invasion;
which in turn implies that the fairly large (Magdalenian)
-----File: 472.png---\tigerswim\BabsP\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
population of the close of the palaeolithic age was in great
part destroyed or expelled by the climatic changes that
coincided with or immediately preceded the advent of the
Mediterranean race. The known characteristics of the
Magdalenian culture indicate a technology, a situation and
perhaps a race, somewhat closely paralleled by the Eskimo;[5]
which argues that the climatic situation before
which this Magdalenian race and culture gave way would
have been that of a genial interglacial period rather than
a period of glaciation.

During this genial (perhaps sub-tropical) inter-glacial
period immediately preceding the last great glaciation the
Magdalenian stock would presumably find Europe climatically
untenable, judging by analogy with the Eskimo;
whereas the Mediterranean stock should have found it an
eminently favorable habitat, for this race has always succeeded
best in a warm-temperate climate. Both the extensive
northward range of the early neolithic (Mediterranean)
settlements and the total disappearance of the
Magdalenian culture from the European continent point to
a climatic situation in Europe more favorable to the former
race and more unwholesome for the latter than the
conditions known to have prevailed at any time since the
last interglacial period, especially in the higher latitudes.
The indications would seem to be that the whole of
Europe, even the Baltic and Arctic seaboards, became climatically
so fully impossible for the Magdalenian race
during this interglacial period as to result in its extinction
or definitive expulsion; for when, in recent times,
climatically suitable conditions return, on the Arctic seaboard,
the culture which takes the place that should have
been occupied by the Magdalenian is the Finnic (Lapp)--*

[Footnote 5: <i>Cf.</i> W. J. Sollas, "Palaeolithic Races and their Modern Representatives,"
<i>Science Progress</i>, vol. iv, 1909-1910.]
-----File: 473.png---\cordra\taurustribe\VerenaM\jander10\Hermit00\--------
a culture unrelated to the Magdalenian either in race or
technology, although of much the same cultural level and
dealing with a material environment of much the same
character. And this genial interval that was fatal to the
Magdalenian was, by just so much, favorable to the Mediterranean
race.

But glacial conditions presently returned, though with
less severity than the next preceding glacial period; and
roughly coincident with the close of the genial interval in
Europe the land connection with Africa was cut off by
submergence, shutting off retreat to the south. How far
communication with Asia may have been interrupted during
the subsequent cold period, by the local glaciation of
the Caucasus, Elburz and Armenian highlands, is for the
present apparently not to be determined, although it is to
be presumed that the outlet to the east would at least be
seriously obstructed during the glaciation. There would
then be left available for occupation, mainly by the Mediterranean
race, central and southern Europe together with
the islands, notably Sicily and Crete, left over as remnants
of the earlier continuous land between Europe and Africa.
The southern extensions of the mainland, and more particularly
the islands, would still afford a favorable place
for the Mediterranean race and its cultural growth. So
that the early phases of the great Cretan (Aegean) civilisation
are presumably to be assigned to this period that
is covered by the last advance of the ice in northern Europe.
But the greater portion of the land area so left
accessible to the Mediterranean race, in central or even in
southern Europe, would have been under glacial or sub-glacial
climatic conditions. For this race, essentially native
to a warm climate, this situation on the European
mainland would be sufficiently novel and trying, particularly
throughout that ice-fringed range of country where
-----File: 474.png---\cordra\BabsP\VerenaM\aagam\Hermit00\-----------------
they would be exposed to such cold and damp as this
race has never easily tolerated.

The situation so outlined would afford such a condition
of physiological strain as might be conceived to throw the
stock into a specifically unstable state and so bring on a
phase of mutation. At the same time this situation, climatic
and technological, would be notably favorable to the
survival and propagation of a type gifted with all the
peculiar capacities and limitations of the dolicho-blond;
so that any mutant showing the traits characteristic of
that type would then have had an eminently favorable
chance of survival. Indeed, it is doubtful, in the present
state of the available evidence, whether such a type of man
could have survived in Europe from or over any period
of quaternary time prior to the last period of glaciation.
The last preceding interglacial period appears to have
been of a sufficiently genial (perhaps sub-tropical) character
throughout Europe to have definitively eliminated
the Magdalenian race and culture, and a variation of climate
in the genial sense sufficiently pronounced to make
Europe absolutely untenable for the Magdalenian--presumed
to be something of a counterpart to the Eskimo
both in race and culture--should probably have reached
the limit of tolerance for the dolicho-blond as well. The
latter is doubtless not as intolerant of a genial--warm-temperate--climate
as the former, but the dolicho-blond
after all stands much nearer to the Eskimo in this matter
of climatic tolerance than to either of the two chief European
stocks with which it is associated. Apparently no
racial stock with a climatic tolerance approximately like
that of the Eskimo, the Magdalenian, or the current races
of the Arctic seaboard, survived over the last inter-glacial
period; and if the dolicho-blond is conceived to have
lived through that period it would appear to have been by
-----File: 475.png---\cordra\taurustribe\VerenaM\jander10\Hermit00\--------
a precariously narrow margin. So that, on one ground
and another, the mutation out of which the dolicho-blond
has arisen is presumably to be assigned to the latest period
of glaciation in Europe, and with some probability to the
time when the latest glaciation was at its maximum, and
to the region where glacial and seaboard influences combined
to give that racial type a differential advantage over
all others.

This dolicho-blond mutation may, of course, have occurred
only once, in a single individual, but it should
seem more probable, in the light of De Vries' experiments,
that the mutation will have been repeated in the
same specific form in several individuals in the same general
locality and in the same general period of time. Indeed,
it would seem highly probably[** typo for probable?] that several typically
distinct mutations will have occurred, repeatedly, at
roughly the same period and in the same region, giving
rise to several new types, some of which, including the
dolicho-blond, will have survived. Many, presumably the
greater number, of these mutant types will have disappeared,
selectively, being unfit to survive under those sub-glacial
seaboard conditions that were eminently favorable
to the dolicho-blond; while other mutants arising out of
the same mutating period and adapted to climatic conditions
of a more continental character, suitable to more of
a continental habitat, less humid, at a higher altitude and
with a wider seasonal variation of temperature, may have
survived in the regions farther inland, particularly eastward
of the selectively defined habitat of the dolicho-blond.
These latter may have given rise to several blond
races, such as are spoken for by Deniker[6] and certain
British ethnologists.

[Footnote 6: <i>The Races of Mankind</i>; and "Les six races composant la
population de l'Europe," <i>Journal Anth. Inst.</i>, 1906.]
-----File: 476.png---\cordra\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\---------------

The same period of mutation may well have given rise
also to one or more brunet types, some of which may
have survived. But if any new brunet type has come up
within a period so recent as this implies, the fact has not
been noted or surmised hitherto--unless the brunet races
spoken for by Deniker are to be accepted as typically distinct
and referred to such an origin. The evidence for
the brunet stocks has not been canvassed with a question
of this kind in view. These stocks have not been subject
of such eager controversy as the dolicho-blond, and the
attention given them has been correspondingly less. The
case of the blond is unique in respect of the attention spent
on questions of its derivation and prehistory, and it is also
singular in respect of the facility with which it can be isolated
for the purposes of such an inquiry. This large and
persistent attention, from all sorts of ethnologists, has
brought the evidence bearing on the dolicho-blond into
such shape as to permit more confident generalisations
regarding that race than any other.

In any case the number of mutant individuals, whether
of one or of several specific types, will have been very
few as compared with the numbers of the parent stock
from which they diverged, even if they may have been
somewhat numerous as counted absolutely, and the survivors
whose offspring produced a permanent effect on the
European peoples will have been fewer still. It results
that these surviving mutants will not have been isolated
from the parent stock, and so could not breed in isolation,
but must forthwith be crossed on the parent stock and
could therefore yield none but hybrid offspring. From
the outset, therefore, the community or communities in
which the blond mutants were propagated would be made
up of a mixture of blond and brunet, with the brunet
greatly preponderating. It may be added that in all
-----File: 477.png---\cordra\taurustribe\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
probability there were also present in this community
from the start one or more minor brunet elements besides
the predominant Mediterranean, and that at least shortly
after the close of the glacial period the new brachycephalic
brunet (Alpine) race comes into the case; so that
the chances favor an early and persistent crossing of the
dolicho-blond with more than one brunet type, and hence
they favor complications and confusion of types from the
start. It follows that, in point of pedigree, according to
this view there neither is nor ever has been a pure-bred
dolicho-blond individual since the putative original mutant
with which the type came in. But under the Mendelian
rule of hybrids it is none the less to be expected that, in
the course of time and of climatically selective breeding,
individuals (perhaps in appreciable numbers) will have
come up from time to time showing the type characters
unmixed and unweakened, and effectively pure-bred in
point of heredity. Indeed, such individuals, effectively
pure-bred or tending to the establishment of a pure line,
will probably have emerged somewhat frequently under
conditions favorable to the pure type. The selective action
of the conditions of life in the habitat most favorable
to the propagation of the dolicho-blond has worked in a
rough and uncertain way toward the establishment, in
parts of the Baltic and North Sea region, of communities
made up prevailingly of blonds. Yet none of these communities
most favorably placed for a selective breeding
in the direction of a pure dolicho-blond population have
gone far enough in that direction to allow it safely to be
said that the composite population of any such given locality
is more than half blond.

Placed as it is in a community of nations made up of a
hybrid mixture of several racial stocks there is probably
no way at present of reaching a convincing demonstration
-----File: 478.png---\KitFry\BabsP\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
of the typical originality of this dolicho-blond mutant, as
contrasted with the other blond types with which it is associated
in the European population; but certain general
considerations go decidedly, perhaps decisively, to enforce
such a view: (a) This type shows such a pervasive resemblance
to a single one of the known older and more widely
distributed types of man (the Mediterranean) as to suggest
descent by mutation from this one rather than derivation
by crossing of any two or more known types. The
like can not be said of the other blond types, all and several
of which may plausibly be explained as hybrids of
known types. They have the appearance of blends, or
rather of biometrical compromises, between two or more
existing varieties of man. Whereas it does not seem
feasible to explain the dolicho-blond as such a blend or
compromise between any known racial types. (b) The
dolicho-blond occurs, in a way, centrally to the other
blond types, giving them a suggestive look of being ramifications
of the blond stock, by hybridisation, into regions
not wholly suited to the typical blond. The like can
scarcely be said for any of the other European types or
races. The most plausible exception would be Deniker's
East-European or Oriental race, Beddoe's Saxon, which
stands in a somewhat analogous spacial relation to the
other blond types. But this brachycephalic blond is not
subject to the same sharp climatic limitations that hedge
about the dolicho-blond; it occurs apparently with equally
secure viability within the littoral home area of the dolicho-blond
and in continental situations where conditions
of altitude and genial climate would bar the latter from
permanent settlement. The ancient and conventionally
accepted center of diffusion of blondness in Europe lies
within the seaboard region bordering on the south Baltic,
the North Sea and the narrow waters of the Scandinavian
-----File: 479.png---\KitFry\taurustribe\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
peninsulas. Probably, if this broad central area of diffusion
were to be narrowed down to a particular spot,
the consensus of opinion as to where the narrower area of
characteristic blondness is to be looked for, would converge
on the lands immediately about the narrow Scandinavian
waters. This would seem to hold true for historic
and for prehistoric times alike. This region is at the
same time, by common consent, the peculiar home of the
dolicho-blond, rather than of any other blond type. (c)
The well known but little discussed climatic limitation of
the blond race applies particularly to the dolicho-blond,
and only in a pronouncedly slighter degree to the other
blond types. The dolicho-blond is subject to a strict regional
limitation, the other blond types to a much less
definite and wider limitation of the same kind. Hence
these others are distributed somewhat widely, over regions
often remote and climatically different from the home area
of the dolicho-blond, giving them the appearance of being
dispersed outward from this home area as hybrid extensions
of the central and typical blond stock. A further
and equally characteristic feature of this selective localisation
of the dolicho-blond race is the fact that while this
race does not succeed permanently outside the seaboard
region of the south Baltic and North Sea, there is no
similar selective bar against other races intruding into
this region. Although the dolicho-blond perhaps succeeds
better within its home area than any other competing
stock or type, yet several other types of man succeed so
well within the same region as to hold it, and apparently
always to have held it, in joint tenancy with the dolicho-blond.

A close relationship, amounting to varietal identity, of
the Kabyle with the dolicho-blond has been spoken for by
Keane and by other ethnologists. But the very different
-----File: 480.png---\armei\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\----------------
climatic tolerance of the two races should put such an
identity out of the question. The Kabyle lives and thrives
best, where his permanent home area has always been, in
a high and dry country, sufficiently remote from the sea
to make it a continental rather than a littoral habitat.
The dolicho-blond, according to all available evidence, can
live in the long run only in a seaboard habitat, damp and
cool, at a high latitude and low altitude. There is no
known instance of this race having gone out from its
home area on the northern seaboard into such a region as
that inhabited by the Kabyle and having survived for an
appreciable number of generations. That this type of
man should have come from Mauritania, where it could
apparently not live under the conditions known to have
prevailed there in the recent or the remoter past, would
seem to be a biologic impossibility. Hitherto, when the
dolicho-blond has migrated into such or a similar habitat
it has not adapted itself to the new climatic requirements
but has presently disappeared off the face of the land.
Indeed, the experiment has been tried in Mauritanian
territory. If the Kabyle blond is to be correlated with
those of Europe, it will in all probability have to be assigned
an independent origin, to be derived from an earlier
mutation of the same Mediterranean stock to which the
dolicho-blond is to be traced.

Questions of race in Europe are greatly obscured by the
prevalence of hybrid types having more or less fixity and
being more or less distinctly localised. The existing European
peoples are hybrid mixtures of two or more racial
stocks. The further fact is sufficiently obvious, though it
has received less critical attention than might be, that
these several hybrid populations have in the course of
time given rise to a number of distinct national and local
types, differing characteristically from one another and
-----File: 481.png---\KitFry\taurustribe\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
having acquired a degree of permanence, such as to simulate
racial characters and show well marked national and
local traits in point of physiognomy and temperament.
Presumably, these national and local types of physique
and temperament are hybrid types that have been selectively
bred into these characteristic forms in adaptation to
the peculiar circumstances of environment and culture
under which each particular local population is required
to live, and that have been so fixed (provisionally) by
selective breeding of the hybrid material subject to such
locally uniform conditions--except so far as the local
characters in question are of the nature of habits and are
themselves therefore to be classed as an institutional element
rather than as characteristics of race.

It is evident that under the Mendelian law of hybridisation
the range of favorable, or viable, variations in any
hybrid population must be very large--much larger than
the range of fluctuating (non-typical) variations obtainable
under any circumstances in a pure-bred race. It also
follows from these same laws of hybridisation that by
virtue of the mutual exclusiveness of allelomorphic characters
or groups of characters it is possible selectively to
obtain an effectually "pure line" of hybrids combining
characters drawn from each of the two or more parent
stocks engaged, and that such a composite pure line may
selectively be brought to a provisional fixity[7] in any such
hybrid population. And under conditions favorable to a
type endowed with any given hybrid combination of characters
so worked out the given hybrid type (composite
pure line) may function in the racial mixture in which it
is so placed very much as an actual racial type would behave
under analogous circumstances; so that, <i>e.g.</i>, under

[Footnote 7: Illustrated by the various pure breeds or "races" of domestic
animals.]
-----File: 482.png---\KitFry\BabsP\SWilkins\jander10\Hermit00\-------------
continued intercrossing such a hybrid population would
tend cumulatively to breed true to this provisionally stable
hybrid type, rather than to the actual racial type represented
by any one of the parent stocks of which the hybrid
population is ultimately made up, unless the local conditions
should selectively favor one or another of these ultimate
racial types. Evidently, too, the number of such
provisionally stable composite pure lines that may be
drawn from any hybrid mixture of two or more parent
stocks must be very considerable--indeed virtually unlimited;
so that on this ground there should be room for
any conceivable number of provisionally stable national or
local types of physique and temperament, limited only by
the number of characteristically distinguishable local environments
or situations that might each selectively act to
characterise and establish a locally characteristic composite
pure line; each answering to the selective exigencies of
the habitat and cultural environment in which it is placed,
and each responding to these exigencies in much the same
fashion as would an actual racial type--provided only
that this provisionally stable composite pure line is not
crossed on pure-bred individuals of either of the parent
stocks from which it is drawn, pure-bred in respect of
the allelomorphic characters which give the hybrid type
its typical traits.

When the hybrid type is so crossed back on one or other
of its parent stocks it should be expected to break down;
but in so slow-breeding a species as man, with so large a
complement of unit characters (some 4000 it has been
estimated), it will be difficult to decide empirically which
of the two lines--the hybrid or the parent stock--proves
itself in the offspring effectively to be a racial type; that is
to say, which of the two (or more) proves to be an ultimately
stable type arisen by a Mendelian mutation, and
-----File: 483.png---\KitFry\taurustribe\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\--------
which is a provisionally stable composite pure line selectively
derived from a cross. The inquiry at this point,
therefore, will apparently have to content itself with arguments
of probability drawn from the varying behavior of
the existing hybrid types under diverse conditions of life.

Such general consideration of the behavior of the blond
types of Europe, other than the dolicho-blond, and more
particularly consideration of their viability under divergent
climatic conditions, should apparently incline to the
view that they are hybrid types, of the nature of provisionally
stable composite pure lines.

So far, therefore, as the evidence has yet been canvassed,
it seems probable on the whole that the dolicho-blond
is the only survivor from among the several mutants
that may have arisen out of this presumed mutating period;
that the other existing blond types, as well as certain
brunets, are derivatives of the hybrid offspring of the
dolicho-blond crossed on the parent Mediterranean stock
or on other brunet stocks with which the race has been in
contact early or late; and that several of these hybrid lines
have in the course of time selectively been established as
provisionally stable types (composite pure lines), breakable
only by a fresh cross with one or other of the parent
types from which the hybrid line sprang, according to the
Mendelian rule.[8]

All these considerations may not be convincing, but they
are at least suggestive to the effect that if originality is to

[Footnote 8: Mr. R. B. Bean's discussion of Deniker's "Six Races," <i>e.g.</i>,
goes far to show that such is probably the standing of the blond
types, other than the dolicho-blond, among these six races of
Europe; although such is not the conclusion to which Mr. Bean
comes. <i>Philippine Journal of Science</i>, September, 1909.]
-----File: 484.png---\KitFry\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Hermit00\--------------
be claimed for any one of the blond types or stocks it can
best be claimed for the dolicho-blond, while the other
blond types may better be accounted for as the outcome
of the crossing of this stock on one or another of the
brunet stocks of Europe.

THE BLOND RACE AND THE ARYAN CULTURE[1]


It has been argued in an earlier paper[2] that the blond
type or types of man (presumably the dolichocephalic
blond) arose by mutation from the Mediterranean stock
during the last period of severe glaciation in Europe.
This would place the emergence of this racial type roughly
coincident with the beginning of the European neolithic;
the evidence going presumptively to show that the neolithic
technology came into Europe with the Mediterranean
race, at or about the same time with that race, and
that the mutation which gave rise to the dolicho-blond took
place after the Mediterranean race was securely settled
in Europe. Since this blond mutant made good its survival
under the circumstances into which it so was thrown
it should presumably be suited by native endowment to the
industrial and climatic conditions that prevailed through
the early phases of the neolithic age in Europe; that is to
say, it would be a type of man selectively adapted to the
technological situation characteristic of the early neolithic
but lacking as yet the domestic animals (and crop-plants?)
that presently give much of its character to that
culture.

Beginning, then, with the period of the last severe glaciation,
and starting with this technological equipment, those
portions of the European population that contained an

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The University of Missouri
Bulletin</i>, Science Series, vol. ii, No. 3.]

[Footnote 2: "The Mutation Theory and the Blond Race," in <i>The Journal
of Race Development</i>, April, 1913.]
-----File: 486.png---\KitFry\taurustribe\VerenaM\JackieB\Hermit00\---------
appreciable and increasing admixture of the blond may be
conceived to have ranged across the breadth of Europe,
particularly in the lowlands, in the belt of damp and cool
country that fringed the ice, and to have followed the receding
ice-sheet northward when the general climate of
Europe began to take on its present character with the
returning warmth and dryness. By force of the strict climatic
limitation to which this type is subject, the blond
element, and more particularly the dolicho-blond, will
presently have disappeared by selective elimination from
the population of those regions from which the ice-sheet
and its fringe of cool and humid climate had receded.
The cool and humid belt suited to the propagation of the
blond mutant (and its blond hybrids) would shift northward
and shorten down to the seaboard as the glacial
conditions in which it had originated presently ceased.
So that presently, when Europe finally lost its ice-sheet,
the blond race and its characteristic hybrids would be
found confined nearly within the bounds which have
marked its permanent extension in historic times. These
limits have, no doubt, fluctuated somewhat in response to
secular variations of climate; but on the whole they appear
to have been singularly permanent and singularly
rigid.

Apparently after the dolicho-blond had come to occupy
the restricted habitat which the stock has since continued
to hold on the northern seaboard of Europe, toward the
close of what is known in Danish chronology as the
"older stone age," the early stock of domestic animals
appear to have been introduced into Europe from Asia;
the like statement will hold more doubtfully for the older
staple crop plants, with the reservation that their introduction
appears to antedate that of the domestic animals.
At least some such date seems indicated by their first ap-*
-----File: 487.png---\KitFry\BabsP\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\--------------
*pearance in Denmark late in the period of the "kitchen
middens." Virtually all of these essential elements of
their material civilisation appear to have come to the
blond-hybrid communities settled on the narrow Scandinavian
waters, as to the rest of Europe, from Turkestan.
This holds true at least for the domestic animals as a
whole, the possible exceptions among the early introductions
being not of great importance. Some of the early
crop plants may well have come from what is now Mesopotamian
or Persian territory, and may conceivably have
reached western Europe appreciably earlier, without affecting
the present argument. If the European horse had
been domesticated in pal√¶olithic times, as appears at least
extremely probable, that technological gain appears to
have been lost before the close of the pal√¶olithic age; perhaps
along with the extinction of the European horse.

These new elements of technological equipment, the
crop plants and animals, greatly affected the character of
the neolithic culture in Europe; visibly so as regards the
region presumably occupied by the dolicho-blond,--or the
blond-hybrid peoples. On the material side of the community's
life they would bring change direct and immediate,
altering the whole scheme of ways and means and
shifting the pursuit of a livelihood to new lines;[** ; or : ?] and on
the immaterial side their effect would be scarcely less important,
in that the new ways and means and the new
manner of life requisite and induced by their use would
bring on certain new institutional features suitable to a
system of mixed farming. Whatever may have been the
manner of their introduction, whether they were transmitted
peaceably by insensible diffusion from group to
group or were carried in with a high hand by a new intrusive
population that overran the country and imposed
its own cultural scheme upon the Europeans along with
-----File: 488.png---\hsnitch\BabsP\SWilkins\aagam\Hermit00\---------------
the new ways and means of life,--in any case these new
cultural elements will have spread over the face of Europe
somewhat gradually and will have reached the blond-hybrid
communities in their remote corner of the continent
only after an appreciable lapse of time. Yet, it is to
be noted, it is after all relatively early in neolithic times
that certain of the domestic plants and animals first come
into evidence in the Scandinavian region.

The crop plants appear to have come in earlier than the
domestic animals, being perhaps brought in by the peoples
of the Mediterranean race at their first occupation of
Europe in late quaternary time. With tillage necessarily
goes a sedentary manner of life. So that at their first
introduction the domestic animals were intruded into a
system of husbandry carried on by a population living in
settled communities, and drawing their livelihood in great
part from the tilled ground but also in part from the sea
and from the game-bearing forests that covered much of
the country at that time. It was into such a situation that
the domestic animals were intruded on their first coming
into Europe,--particularly into the seaboard region of
north Europe.

On the open ranges of western and central Asia, from
which these domestic animals came, and even in the hill
country of that general region, the peoples that draw their
livelihood from cattle and sheep are commonly of a nomadic
habit of life, in the sense that the requirements of
forage for their herds and flocks hold them to an unremitting
round of seasonal migration. It results that, except
in the broken hill country, these peoples habitually
make use of movable habitations, live in camps rather
than in settled, sedentary communities. Certain peculiar
institutional arrangements also result from this nomadic
manner of life associated with the care of flocks and herds
-----File: 489.png---\samwilson\BabsP\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\-----------
on a large scale. But on their introduction into Europe
the domestic animals appear on the whole not to have supplanted
tillage and given rise to such a nomadic-pastoral
scheme of life, exclusively given to cattle raising, but
rather to have fallen into a system of mixed farming
which combined tillage with a sedentary or quasi-sedentary
grazing industry. Such particularly appears to have
been the case in the seaboard region of the north, where
there is no evidence of tillage having been displaced by a
nomadic grazing industry. Indeed, the small-scale and
broken topography of this European region has never
admitted a large-scale cattle industry, such as has prevailed
on the wide Asiatic ranges. An exception, at least
partial and circumscribed, may perhaps be found in the
large plains of the extreme Southeast and in the Danube
valley; and it appears also that grazing, after the sedentary
fashion, took precedence of tillage in prehistoric
Ireland as well as here and there in the hilly countries of
southern and central Europe.

Such an introduction of tillage and grazing would mean
a revolutionary change in the technology of the European
stone age, and a technological revolution of this kind will
unavoidably bring on something of a radical change in the
scheme of institutions under which the community lives;
primarily in the institutions governing the details of its
economic life, but secondarily also in its domestic and
civil relations. When such a change comes about through
the intrusion of new material factors the presumption
should be that the range of institutions already associated
with these material factors in their earlier home will
greatly influence the resulting new growth of institutions
in the new situation, even if circumstances may not permit
these alien institutions to be brought in and put into effect
with the scope and force which they may have had in the
-----File: 490.png---\Pitirim\taurustribe\SWilkins\JackieB\Hermit00\-------
culture out of which they have come. Some assimilation
is to be looked for even if circumstances will not permit
the adoption of the full scheme of institutions, and the
institutions originally associated with the intrusive technology
will be found surviving with least loss or qualification
in those portions of the invaded territory where the
invaders have settled in force, and particularly where
conditions have permitted them to retain something of
their earlier manner of life.

The bringers of these new elements of culture, material
and immaterial, had acquired what they brought with
them on the open sheep and cattle ranges of the central-Asiatic
plains and uplands,--as is held to be the unequivocal
testimony of the Aryan speech, and as is borne out
by the latest explorations in that region. These later explorations
indicate west-central Turkestan as the probable
center of the domestication and diffusion of the animals,
if not also of the crop plants, that have stocked Europe.
Of what race these bearers of the new technology and
culture may have been, and just what they brought into
Europe, is all a matter of inference and surmise. It was
once usual to infer, as a ready matter of course, that these
immigrant pastoral nomads from the Asiatic uplands were
"Aryans," "Indo-Europeans," "Indo-Germans," of a
predominantly blond physique. But what has been said
above as well as in the earlier paper referred to comes
near excluding the possibility of these invaders being
blonds, or more specifically the dolicho-blond. It is, of
course, conceivable, with Keane (if his speculations on
this head are to be taken seriously), that a fragment of
the alleged blond race from Mauretania may have wandered
off into Turkestan by way of the Levant, and so
may there have acquired the habits of a pastoral life, together
with the Aryan speech and institutions, and may
-----File: 491.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\----------------
then presently have carried these cultural factors into
Europe and imposed them on the European population,
blond and brunet. But such speculations, which once
were allowable though idle, have latterly been put out of
all question, at least for the present, by the recent Pumpelly
explorations in Turkestan. It is, for climatic reasons,
extremely improbable that any blond stock should
have inhabited any region of the central-Asiatic plains or
uplands long enough to acquire the pastoral habits of life
and the concomitant Aryan speech and institutions, and it
is fairly certain that the dolicho-blond could not have survived
for that length of time under the requisite conditions
of climate and topography.

It is similarly quite out of the question that the dolicho-blond,
arising as a mutant type late in quaternary time,
should have created the Aryan speech and culture in Europe,
since neither the arch√¶ological evidence nor the
known facts of climate and topography permit the hypothesis
that a pastoral-nomadic culture of home growth
has ever prevailed in Europe on a scale approaching that
required for such a result. And there is but little more
possibility that the bringers of the new (Aryan) culture
should have been of the Mediterranean race; although the
explorations referred to make it nearly certain that the
communities which domesticated the pastoral animals
(and perhaps the crop-plants) in Turkestan were of that
race. The Mediterranean race originally is Hamitic, not
Aryan, it is held by men competent to speak on that matter,
and the known (presumably) Mediterranean prehistoric
settlements in Turkestan, at Anau, are moreover
obviously the settlements of a notably sedentary people
following a characteristically peaceable mode of life.
The population of these settlements might of course conceivably
have presently acquired the nomadic and preda-*
-----File: 492.png---\Pitirim\taurustribe\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\----------
*tory habits reflected by the Aryan speech and institutions,
but there is no evidence of such an episode at Anau, where
the finds show an uninterrupted peaceable and sedentary
occupation of the sites throughout the period that could
come in question. The population of the settlements at
Anau could scarcely have made such a cultural innovation,
involving the adoption of an alien language, except under
the pressure of conquest by an invading people; which
would involve the subjection of the peaceable communities
of Anau and the incorporation of their inhabitants as
slaves or as a servile class in the predatory organisation
of their masters. The Mediterranean people of Anau
could accordingly have had a hand in carrying this pastoral-predatory
(Aryan) culture into the West only as a
subsidiary racial element in a migratory community made
up primarily of another racial stock.

This leaves the probability that an Asiatic stock, without
previous settled sedentary habits of life, acquired the
domesticated animals from the sedentary and peaceable
communities of Anau, or from some similar village
(pueblo) or villages of western Turkestan, and then
through a (moderately) long experience of nomadic pastoral
life acquired also the predatory habits and institutions
that commonly go with a pastoral life on a large
scale. These cultural traits they acquired in such a degree
of elaboration and maturity as is implied by the
primitive Aryan (or, better, proto-Aryan) speech, including
a more or less well developed patriarchal system; so
that they would presently become a militant and migratory
community somewhat after the later-known Tatar
fashion, and so made their way westward as a self-sufficient
migratory host and carried the new material
culture into Europe together with the alien Aryan speech.
It is at the same time almost unavoidable that in such an
-----File: 493.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\----------------
event this migratory host would have carried with them
into the West an appreciable servile contingent made up
primarily of enslaved captives from the peaceable agricultural
settlements of the Mediterranean race, which had
originally supplied them with their stock of domestic
animals.

Along with these new technological elements and the
changes of law and custom which their adoption would
bring on, there will also have come in the new language
that was designed to describe these new ways and means
of life and was adapted to express the habits of thought
which the new ways and means bred in the peoples that
adopted them. The immigrant pastoral (proto-Aryan)
language and the pastoral (patriarchal and predatory)
law and custom will in some degree have been bound up
with the technological ways and means out of which they
arose, and they would be expected to have reached and
affected the various communities of Europe in somewhat
the same time and the same measure in which these material
facts of the pastoral life made their way among these
peoples. In the course of the diffusion of these cultural
elements, material and immaterial, among the European
communities the language and in a less degree the domestic
and civil usages and ideals bred by the habits of the
pastoral life might of course come to be dissociated from
their material or technological basis and might so be
adopted by remoter peoples who never acquired any large
measure of the material culture of those pastoral nomads
whose manner of life had once given rise to these immaterial
features of Aryan civilisation.

<tb>

Certain considerations going to support this far-flung
line of conjectural history may be set out more in detail:
(a) The Aryan civilisation is of the pastoral type, with
-----File: 494.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\aagam\Scholar\------------------
such institutions, usages and preconceptions as a large-scale
pastoral organisation commonly involves. Such is
said by competent philologists to be the evidence of the
primitive Aryan speech. It is substantially a servile organisation
under patriarchal rule, or, if the expression be
preferred, a militant or predatory organisation; these alternative
phrases describe the same facts from different
points of view. It is characterised by a well-defined system
of property rights, a somewhat pronounced subjection
of women and children, and a masterful religious
system tending strongly to monotheism. A pastoral culture
on the broad plains and uplands of a continental region,
such as west-central Asia, will necessarily fall into
some such shape, because of the necessity of an alert and
mobile readiness for offense and defense and the consequent
need of soldierly discipline. Insubordination,
which is the substance of free institutions, is incompatible
with a prosperous pastoral-nomadic mode of life. When
worked out with any degree of maturity and consistency
the pastoral-nomadic culture that has to do with sheep and
cattle appears always to have been a predatory, and therefore
a servile culture, particularly when drawn on the
large scale imposed by the topography of the central-Asiatic
plains, and re√´nforced with the use of the horse.
(The reindeer nomads of the arctic seaboard may appear
to be an exception, at least in a degree, but they are a special
case, admitting a particular explanation, and their
case does not affect the argument for the Aryan civilisation.)
The characteristic and pervasive human relation
in such a culture is that of master and servant, and the
social (domestic and civil) structure is an organisation of
graded servitude, in which no one is his own master but
the overlord, even nominally. The family is patriarchal,
women and children are in strict tutelage, and discretion
-----File: 495.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\----------------
vests in the male head alone. If the group grows large
its civil institutions are of a like coercive character, it
commonly shows a rigorous tribal organisation, and in
the end, with the help of warlike experience, it almost
unavoidably becomes a despotic monarchy.

It has not been unusual to speak of the popular institutions
of Germanic paganism--typified, <i>e.g.</i>, by the Scandinavian
usages of local self-government in pagan times--as
being typically Aryan institutions, but that is a misnomer
due to uncritical generalisation guided by a chauvinistic
bias. These ancient north-European usages are
plainly alien to the culture reflected by the primitive Aryan
Speech, if we are to accept the consensus of the philological
ethnologists to the effect that the people who used the
primitive Aryan speech must have been a community of
pastoral nomads inhabiting the plains and uplands of a
continental region. That many of these philological ethnologists
also hold to the view that these Aryans were
north-European pagan blonds may raise a personal question
of consistency but does not otherwise touch the present
argument.

(b) A racial stock that has ever been of first-rate consequence
in the ethnology of Europe (the Alpine, brachycephalic
brunet, the <i>homo alpinus</i> of the Linnean scheme)
comes into Europe at this general period, from Asia; and
this race is held to have presently made itself at home, if
not dominant, throughout middle Europe, where it has in
historic times unquestionably been the dominant racial
element.

(c) The pastoral-nomadic institutions spoken of above
appear to have best made their way in those regions of
Europe where this brachycephalic brunet stock has been
present in some force if not as a dominant racial factor.
The evidence is perhaps not conclusive, but there is at
-----File: 496.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\Neanderthal\Scholar\-----------
least a strong line of suggestion afforded by the distribution
of the patriarchal type of institutions within Europe,
including the tribal and gentile organisation. There is a
rough concomitance between the distribution of these cultural
elements presumably derived from an Aryan source
on the one hand, and the distribution past or present of
the brachycephalic brunet type on the other hand. The
regions where this line of institutions are known to have
prevailed in early times are, in the main, regions in which
the Alpine racial type is also known to have been present
in force, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the classic Greek and Roman republics.

At the same time a gentile organisation seems also to
have been associated from the outset with the Mediterranean
racial stock and may well have been comprised in
the institutional furniture of that race as it stood before
the advent of the Alpine stock; but the drift of later inquiry
and speculation on this head appears to support the
view that this Mediterranean gentile system was of a
matrilinear character, such as is found in many extant
agricultural communities of the lower barbarian culture,
rather than of a patriarchal kind, such as characterises the
pastoral nomads. The northern blond communities alone
appear, on the available evidence, to have had no gentile
or tribal institutions, whether matrilinear or patriarchal.
The classic Greek and Roman communities appear originally
to have been of the Mediterranean race and to have
always retained a broad substratum of the Mediterranean
stock as the largest racial element in their population, but
the Alpine stock was also largely represented in these
communities at the period when their tribal and gentile
institutions are known to have counted for much, as, indeed,
it has continued ever since.

Apart from these communities of the Mediterranean
seaboard, the peoples of the Keltic culture appear to have
-----File: 497.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\jander10\Scholar\---------------
had the tribal and gentile system, together with the patriarchal
family, in more fully developed form than it is to
be found in Europe at large. The peoples of Keltic
speech are currently believed by ethnologists to have originally
been of a blond type, although opinions are not altogether
at one on that head,--the tall, perhaps red-haired,
brachycephalic blond, the "Saxon" of Beddoe, the "Oriental"
of Deniker. But this blond type is perhaps best
accounted for as a hybrid of the dolicho-blond crossed on
the Alpine brachycephalic brunet. Some such view of its
derivation is fortified by what is known of the prehistory
and the peculiar features of the early Keltic culture.
This culture differs in some respects radically from that
of the dolicho-blond communities, and it bears more of a
resemblance to the culture of such a brunet group of
peoples as the early historic communities of upper and
middle Italy. If the view is to be accepted which is coming
into currency latterly, that the Keltic is to be affiliated
with the culture of Hallstatt and La T√®ne, such affiliation
will greatly increase the probability that it is to be counted
as a culture strongly influenced if not dominated by the
Alpine stock. The Hallstatt culture, lying in the valley
of the Danube and its upper affluents, lay in the presumed
westward path of immigration of the Alpine stock; its
human remains are of a mixed character, showing a
strong admixture of the brachycephalic brunet type; and
it gives evidence of cultural gains due to outside influence
in advance of the adjacent regions of Europe. This Keltic
culture, then, as known to history and prehistory, runs
broadly across middle Europe along the belt where blond
and brunet elements meet and blend; and it has some of
the features of that predatory-pastoral culture reflected
by the primitive Aryan speech, in freer development, or
in better preservation, than the adjacent cultural regions
-----File: 498.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Scholar\---------------
to the north; at the same time the peoples of this Keltic
culture show more of affiliation to or admixture with the
brachycephalic brunet than the other blond-hybrid peoples
do.

On the other hand the communities of dolicho-blond
hybrids on the shores of the narrow Scandinavian waters,
remote from the centers of the Alpine culture, show little
of the institutions peculiar to a pastoral people. These
dolicho-blond hybrids of the North come into history at a
later date, but with a better preserved and more adequately
recorded paganism than the other barbarians of
Europe. The late-pagan Germanic-Scandinavian culture
affords the best available instance of archaic dolicho-blond
institutions, if not the sole instance; and it is to be noted
that among these peoples the patriarchal system is weak
and vague,--women are not in perpetual tutelage, the discretion
of the male head of the household is not despotic
nor even unquestioned, children are not held under paternal
discretion beyond adult age, the patrimony is held to
no clan liabilities and is readily divisible on inheritance,
and so forth. Neither is there any serious evidence of a
tribal or gentile system among these peoples, early or late,
nor are any of them, excepting the late and special instance
of the Icelandic colony, known ever to have been
wholly or mainly of pastoral habits; indeed, they are
known to have been without the pastoral animals until
some time in the neolithic period. The only dissenting
evidence on these heads is that of the Latin writers, substantially
C√¶sar and Tacitus, whose testimony is doubtless
to be thrown out as incompetent in view of the fact that
it is supported neither by circumstantial evidence nor by
later and more authentic records. In speaking of
"tribes" among the Germanic hordes these Latin writers
are plainly construing Germanic facts in Roman terms,
-----File: 499.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\----------------
very much as the Spanish writers of a later day construed
Mexican and Peruvian facts in medi√¶val-feudalistic
terms,--to the lasting confusion of the historians;
whereas in enlarging on the pastoral habits of the Germanic
communities they go entirely on data taken from
bodies of people on the move and organised for raiding,
or recently and provisionally settled upon a subject population
presumably of Keltic derivation or of other alien
origin and inhabiting the broad lands of middle Europe
remote from the permanent habitat of the dolicho-blond.
Great freedom of assumption has been used and much
ingenuity has been spent in imputing a tribal system to
the early Germanic peoples, but apart from the sophisticated
testimony of these classical writers there is no
evidence for it. The nearest approach to a tribal or a
gentile organisation within this culture is the "kin" which
counts for something in early Germanic law and custom;
but the kin is far from being a gens or clan, and it will be
found to have more of the force of a clan organisation
the farther it has strayed from the Scandinavian center
of diffusion of the dolicho-blond and the more protracted
the warlike discipline to which the wandering host has
been exposed. All these properly Aryan institutions are
weakest or most notably wanting where the blond is most
indubitably in evidence.

Taking early Europe as a whole, it will appear that
among the European peoples at large institutions of the
character reflected in the primitive Aryan speech and implied
in the pastoral-nomadic life evidenced by the same
speech are relatively weak, ill-defined or wanting, arguing
that Europe was never fully Aryanised. And the peculiar
geographical and ethnic distribution of this Aryanism of
institutions argues further that the dolicho-blond culture
of the Scandinavian region was less profoundly affected
-----File: 500.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Scholar\--------------
by the Aryan invasion than any other equally well known
section of Europe. What is known of this primitive
Aryan culture, material, domestic, civil and religious,
through the Sanskrit and other early Asiatic sources, may
convincingly be contrasted with what is found in early
Europe. These Asiatic records, which are our sole dependence
for a competent characterisation of the Aryan
culture, shows it to have resembled the culture of the
early Hebrews or that of the pastoral Turanians more
closely than it resembles the early European culture at
large, and greatly more than it resembles the known culture
of the early communities of dolicho-blond hybrids.

(d) Scarcely more conclusive, but equally suggestive,
is the evidence from the religious institutions of the Aryanised
Europeans. As would be expected in any predatory
civilisation, such as the pastoral-nomadic cultures
typically are, the Aryan religious system is said to have
leaned strongly toward a despotic monarchical form, a
hierarchically graded polytheism, culminating in a despotic
monotheism. There is little of all this to be found
in early pagan Europe. The nearest well-known approach
to anything of the kind is the late-Greek scheme of
Olympian divinities with Zeus as a doubtful suzerain,--known
through latter-day investigations to have been
superimposed on an earlier cult of a very different character.
The Keltic (Druidical) system is little known, but
it is perhaps not beyond legitimate conjecture, on the
scant evidence available, that this system had rather more
of the predatory, monarchical-despotic cast than the better
known pagan cults of Europe. The Germanic paganism,
as indicated by the late Scandinavian--which alone is
known in any appreciable degree--was a lax polytheism
which imputed little if any coercive power to the highest
god, and which was not taken so very seriously anyway
-----File: 501.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Scholar\---------------
by the "worshipers,"--if Snorri's virtually exclusive account
is to be accepted without sophistication. The evidence
accorded by the religious cults of Europe yields
little that is conclusive, beyond throwing the whole loose-jointed,
proliferous European paganism out of touch with
anything that can reasonably be called Aryan. And this
in spite of the fact that all the available evidence is derived
from the European cults as they stood after having
been exposed to long centuries of Aryanisation. So that
it may well be held that such systematisation of myths
and observances as these European cults give evidence of,
and going in the direction of a despotic monotheism, is to
be traced to the influence of the intrusive culture of the
Aryan or Aryanised invaders,--as is fairly plain in the
instance of the Olympians.

(e) That the languages of early Europe, so far as
known, belong almost universally to the Aryan family
may seem an insurmountable obstacle to the view here
spoken for. But the difficulties of the case are not appreciably
lessened by so varying the hypothesis as to impute
the Aryan speech to the dolicho-blond, or to any blond
stock, as its original bearer. Indeed, the difficulties are
increased by such an hypothesis, since the Aryan-speaking
peoples of early times, as of later times, have in the main
been communities made up of brunets without evidence of
a blond admixture, not to speak of an exclusively blond
people. (There is no evidence of the existence of an
all-blond people anywhere, early or late.)

The early European situation, so far as known, offers
no exceptional obstacles to the diffusion of an intrusive
language. Certain mass movements of population, or
rather mass movements of communities shifting their
ground by secular progression, are known to have taken
place, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the case of the Hallstatt-La T√®ne-Keltic
-----File: 502.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\comyn7\jander10\Scholar\---------------
culture moving westward on the whole as it gained ground
and spread by shifting and ramification outward from its
first-known seat in the upper Danube valley. All the
while, as this secular movement of growth, ramification
and advance was going on, the Hallstatt-La T√®ne-Keltic
peoples continued to maintain extensive trade relations
with the Mediterranean seaboard and the √Ügean on the
one side and reaching the North-Sea littoral on the other
side. In all probability it is by trade relations of this
kind--chiefly, no doubt, through trade carried on by
itinerant merchants--that the new speech made its way
among the barbarians of Europe; and it is no far-fetched
inference that it made its way, in the North at least, as a
trade jargon. All this accords with what is going on at
present under analogous circumstances. The superior
merit by force of which such a new speech would make its
way need be nothing more substantial than a relatively
crude syntax and phonetics--such as furthers the dissemination
of English to-day in the form of Chinook
jargon, Pidgin English, and Beach la Mar. Such traits,
which might in some other light seem blemishes, facilitate
the mutilation of such a language into a graceless but
practicable trade jargon. With jargons as with coins the
poorer (simpler) drives out the better (subtler and more
complex). A second, and perhaps the chief, point of superiority
by virtue of which a given language makes its
way as the dominant factor in such a trade jargon, is the
fact that it is the native language of the people who carry
on the trade for whose behoof the jargon is contrived.
The traders, coming in contact with many men, of varied
speech, and carrying their varied stock of trade goods,
will impose their own names for the articles bartered and
so contribute that much to the jargon vocabulary,--and
a jargon is at its inception little more than a vocabulary.
-----File: 503.png---\KitFry\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\-----------------
The traders at the same time are likely to belong to the
people possessed of the more efficient technology, since it
is the superior technology that commonly affords them
their opportunity for advantageous trade; hence the new
or intrusive words, being the names of new or intrusive
facts, will in so far find their way unhindered into current
speech and further the displacement of the indigenous
language by the jargon.

Such a jargon at the outset is little else than a vocabulary
comprising names for the most common objects and
the most tangible relations. On this simple but practicable
framework new varieties of speech will develop,
diversified locally according to the kind and quantity of
materials and linguistic tradition contributed by the various
languages which it supplants or absorbs.

In so putting forward the conjecture that the several
forms of Aryan speech have arisen out of trade jargons
that have run back to a common source in the language of
an intrusive proto-Aryan people, and developing into
widely diversified local and ethnic variants according as
the mutilated proto-Aryan speech (vocabulary) fell into
the hands of one or another of the indigenous barbarian
peoples,--in this suggestion there is after all nothing substantially
novel beyond giving a collective name to facts
already well accepted by the philologists. Working backward
analytically step by step from the mature results
given in the known Aryan languages they have discovered
and divulged--with what prolixity need not be alluded
to here--that in their beginnings these several
idioms were little else than crude vocabularies covering
the commonest objects and most tangible relations, and
that by time-long use and wont the uncouth strings of
vocables whereby the beginners of these languages sought
to express themselves have been worked down through a
-----File: 504.png---\KitFry\BabsP\comyn7\JackieB\Scholar\-----------------
stupendously elaborate fabric of prefixes, infixes and suffixes,
etc., etc., to the tactically and phonetically unexceptionable
inflected languages of the Aryan family as they
stood at their classical best. And what is true of the
European languages should apparently hold with but
slight modification for the Asiatic members of the family.
These European idioms are commonly said to be, on the
whole, less true to the pattern of the inferentially known
primitive Aryan than are its best Asiatic representatives;
as would be expected in case the latter were an outgrowth
of jargons lying nearer the center of diffusion of the
proto-Aryan speech and technology.

As regards the special case of the early north-European
communities of dolicho-blond hybrids, the trade between
the Baltic and Danish waters on the one hand and the
Danube valley, Adriatic and √Ügean on the other hand is
known to have been continued and voluminous during the
neolithic and bronze ages,--as counted by the Scandinavian
chronology. In the course of this traffic, extending
over many centuries and complicated as it seems to have
been with a large infiltration of the brachycephalic brunet
type, much might come to pass in the way of linguistic
substitution and growth.

AN EARLY EXPERIMENT IN TRUSTS[1]


According to Much,[2] following in the main the views of
Penka, Wilser, De Lapouge, Sophus M√ºller, Andreas
Hansen, and other spokesmen of the later theories touching
Aryan origins, the area of characterisation of the
West-European culture, as well as of that dolicho-blond
racial stock that bears this culture, is the region bordering
on the North Sea and the Baltic, and its center of diffusion
is to be sought on the southern shores of the
Baltic. This region is in a manner, then, the primary
focus of that culture of enterprise that has reshaped the
scheme of life for mankind during the Christian era. Its
spirit of enterprise and adventure has carried this race to
a degree of material success that is without example in
history, whether in point of the extent or of the scope
of its achievements. Up to the present the culminating
achievement of this enterprise is dominion in business,
and its most finished instrument is the quasi-voluntary
coalition of forces known as a Trust.

In its method and outward form this enterprise of the
Indo-germanic racial stock has varied with the passage
of time and the change of circumstances; but in its spirit
and objective end it has maintained a singularly consistent
character through all the mutations of name and
external circumstance that have passed over it in the
course of history.

In its earlier, more elemental expression this enterprise

[Footnote 1: Reprinted by permission from <i>The Journal of Political Economy</i>,
Vol. XII, March, 1904.]

[Footnote 2: <sc>Matthaeus Much</sc>, <i>Die Heimat der Indogermanen</i>.]
-----File: 506.png---\KitFry\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Scholar\---------------
takes the form of raiding, by land and sea. A shrewd
interpretation might, without particular violence to the
facts, find a coalition of forces of the kind which is later
known as a Trust in the Barbarian raids spoken of as the
<i>V√∂lkerwanderung</i>. Such an interpretation would seem
remote, however, and not particularly apt. The beginnings
of a <i>bona fide</i> trust enterprise are of a more businesslike
character and have left a record more amenable
to the tests of accountancy. A trust, as that term is
colloquially understood, is a business organisation.

Now, the line of enterprise, of indigenous growth in
the north-European cultural region, which first falls into
settled shape as an orderly, organised business is the
traffic of those seafaring men of the North known to
fame as the Vikings. And it is in this traffic, so far as
the records show, that a trust, with all essential features,
is first organised. The term "viking" covers, somewhat
euphemistically, two main facts: piracy and slave-trade.
Without both of these lines of business the traffic
could not be maintained in the long run; and both, but
more particularly the latter, presume, as an indispensable
condition to their successful prosecution, a regular market
and an assured demand for the output. It is a traffic in
which, in order to get the best results, a relatively large
initial investment must be sunk, and the period of turnover--the
"period of production"--is necessarily of
some duration; the risk is also considerable. Further,
certain technological prerequisites must be met, in the
way particularly of shipbuilding, navigation, and the
manufacture of weapons; an adequate accumulation of
capital goods must be had, coupled with a sagacious spirit
of adventure; there must also be an available supply of
labor. There appears to have been a concurrence of all
these circumstances, together with favorable market con-*
-----File: 507.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Scholar\--------------
*ditions, in the south-Baltic region from about the sixth
century onward; the circumstances apparently growing
gradually more favorable through the succeeding four
centuries.

The viking trade appears to have grown up gradually
on the Baltic seaboard, as well as in the Sound country
and throughout the fjord region of Norway, as a by-occupation
of the farming population. Its beginnings are
earlier than any records, so that the earliest traditions
speak of it as an institution well understood and fully
legitimate. The well-to-do freehold farmers, including
some who laid claim to the rank of <i>jarl</i>, seem to have
found it an agreeable and honorable diversion, as well
as a lucrative employment for their surplus wealth and
labor supply. From such sporadic and occasional beginnings
it passed presently into an independently organised
and self-sustaining line of business enterprise, and
in the course of time it attained a settled business routine
and a defined code of professional ethics. Syndication,
of a loose form, had begun as early as the oldest accounts
extant, but it is evident from the way in which the
matter is spoken of that combination had not at that
date--say, about the beginning of the ninth century--long
been the common practice. It was not then a matter
of course. The early combinations were relatively
small and transient. They took the form of "gentlemen's
agreements," pools, working arrangements, division
of territory, etc., rather than hard and fast syndicates.
In those early days a combine would be formed
for a season between two or more capitalist-undertakers,
for the most part employing their own capital only, without
recourse to credit; although credit arrangements occur
quite early, but are not very common in the earlier
recorded phases of the trade. Such a loose combine, say
-----File: 508.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Scholar\---------------
about the middle of the ninth century, might comprise
from two to a dozen boats. What may be called the
normal unit in the trade at that time was a boat of perhaps
thirty tons' burden, with an effective crew of some
eighty men. Boats and crews gradually increase both
in size and efficiency for a century and a half after that
time.

Syndication, of an increasingly close texture and increasingly
permanent effect, appears to have rapidly
grown in favor through the ninth and tenth centuries.
The reasons for this movement of coalition are plain.
The volume of the trade, as well as its territorial extension,
increased uninterruptedly. The technique of the
trade was gradually improved, and the equipment and
management were improved and reduced to standard
forms. The tonnage employed at any given time can, of
course, not be ascertained with anything like a confident
approximation; but its steady increase is unmistakable.
Year by year the boats and crews increase in average
size as well as in number, until by the middle of the
tenth century the number of men and ships engaged, as
well as the volume of capital invested in the trade, are
probably larger than the corresponding figures for any
other form of lucrative enterprise at that time. It is,
at that time, altogether the best-organised line of enterprise
in the West-European region in respect of its business
management, and the most efficient and progressive
in respect of its equipment and technology. At a conservative
guess, the aggregate number of ships engaged
about the middle of the tenth century must have appreciably
exceeded six hundred, and may have reached one
thousand; with crews which had also grown gradually
larger until they may by this time have averaged 150
or 200 men. There was consequently what would in
-----File: 509.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\jander10\Scholar\--------------
modern phrase be called an "overproduction" of piratical
craft--overinvestment in the viking trade and consequent
cut-throat competition. The various coalitions
came into violent conflict, and many of them went under,
with great resultant loss of capital, impoverishment of
well-to-do families, hardship and demoralisation of the
entire trade.

Added to these untoward conditions within the trade
was the open disfavor of the crown, in each of the three
Scandinavian kingdoms. The traffic had long passed out
of the stage at which it had offered a lucrative opening
for farmers' sons who were tired of the farm and eager
to find excitement, reputation, and creature comforts in
that wider human contact and busier life for which the
tedium of the farm had sharpened their appetites. The
larger capitalists alone could succeed as organisers or
directors of a viking concern under the changed conditions.
The common run of well-to-do farmers had
neither the tangible assets nor the "good-will" requisite
to the successful promotion of a new company of freebooters.
At the best, their sons could enter the business
only as employees and with but a very uncertain outlook
to speedy promotion to an executive position. On the
other hand, as the trade became better organised in
stronger hands, with a larger equipment, and as the competition
within the trade grew more severe, the blackmail
from which much of the profits of the trade was
drawn grew more excessive and more uncertain, both as
to its amount and as to the manner and incidents with
which it was levied. As competition grew severe and
the small vikings practically disappeared, and as the
demoralisation that goes with cut-throat competition set
in, the livelihood of the common people, at whose expense
the vikings lived, grew progressively more precarious, and
-----File: 510.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\windymilla\JackieB\Scholar\------------
even their domestic peace and household industry grew
insecure. Popular sentiment was running strongly
against the whole traffic. So much so, indeed, as to
threaten the tenure of courts and sovereigns if the popular
hardship incident to the continuance of the trade
were not abated.

The politicians, therefore, made a strenuous show of
effort to regulate, or even to repress, the viking organisations.
Outright and indiscriminate repression was
scarcely a feasible remedy, certainly not an agreeable
one. The viking companies were a source of strength
to the country, both in that they might be drawn on for
support in case of war and in that they brought funds
into the country. The remedy to which the politicians
turned, by preference, therefore, was a regulation of the
companies in such a manner as to let "the foreigners pay
the tax," to adapt a modern phrase. If the freebooters
of a given state could be induced, by stringent regulations,
to prey upon the people of the neighboring states, and
particularly if they worked at cross-purposes with similar
companies of freebooters domiciled in such neighboring
states, it was then plain to the sagacious politicians of
those days that the companies might be more of a blessing
than a curse. On trial it was found that this policy
of control gave at the best but very dubious results, and
consequently the repressive hand of the authorities perforce
fell with increasingly rigorous pressure on the viking
organisations, particularly on the smaller ones which
were scarcely of national importance. The competition
in the trade was too severe to admit of a consistent avoidance
of excesses and irregularities on the part of the
vikings, and these irregularities obliged the authorities to
interfere.

Under these circumstances it is plain that no viking
-----File: 511.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Scholar\---------------
combine could hope to prosper in the long run unless it
were strong enough to take an international position and
to maintain a practical monopoly of the trade. "International"
in these premises means within the Scandinavian
countries. In the days of its finest development the
viking trade was domiciled in the Scandinavian countries,
almost exclusively. This means the two Scandinavian
peninsulas, with Iceland, the Faroes, Orkneys, Hebrides,
and the Scandinavian portions of Scotland. To this, for
completeness of statement, is to be added a stretch of
Wendish seaboard on the south of the Baltic and a negligible
patch of German territory. The trade, so far as
regards its home offices, to use a modern phrase, gathered
in the main about two chief centers: the Orkneys
and the south end of the Baltic. Outlying regions, such
as the Norwegian fjord country and the Hebrides, are
by no means negligible, but the two regions named above
are after all the chief seats of the traffic; and of these
two centers the Baltic--chiefly Danish--region is in
many respects the more notable. Its viking traffic is better,
more regularly organised, is carried on with a more
evident sense of a solidarity of interests and a more consistent
view to a long-term prosperity. As one might
say, looking at the matter from the modern standpoint,
it has more of a look of stability and conservative management,
such as belongs to an investment business, and
has less of a speculative air, than the trade that centers
in the western isles.

Perhaps it is just on this account, because of its greater
stability of interests and more conservative animus, that
the traffic of this region responds with greater alacrity
to the pressure of excessive competition and political interference,
and so enters on a policy of larger and closer
coalition. It may be added that many of the great
-----File: 512.png---\Pitirim\Ymartin\VerenaM\jander10\Scholar\------------
captains of adventure in this region are men of good
family and substantial standing in the community. As
may often happen in a like conjuncture, when the irksomeness
of this competitive situation in the Baltic was
fast becoming intolerable, there arose a man of far-seeing
sagacity and settled principles, of executive ability and
businesslike integrity, who saw the needs of the hour and
the available remedy, and who saw at the same glance
his own opportunity of gain. This man was P√°lnatoki,
the descendant of an honorable line of country gentlemen
in the island of Funen, whose family had from
time immemorial borne an active and prudent part in the
trade, and had been well seen at court and in society.
He was a man of mature experience, with a large investment
in the traffic, and with a body of "good-will" that
gave him perhaps his most decisive advantage.

During the reign of Harald Gormsson, about the middle
of the tenth century, P√°lnatoki seems to have cast
about for a basis on which to promote an international
coalition of vikings, such as would put an end to headlong
competition in the trade and would at the same time
be placed above the accidents of national politics. To
this end it was necessary to find a neutral ground on
which to establish the home office of the concern. Such
a medi√¶val-Scandinavian New Jersey was the Wendish
kingdom at the south of the Baltic.

J√≥msborg (on the island of Wollin, at the mouth of
the Oder) seems to have been a resort of vikings before
P√°lnatoki organised his company there and strengthened
the harbor, which may have been fortified by those who
held it before him. Here the new company was incorporated
under a special franchise from the Wendish
crown, with the stipulation that it was to do business only
outside the Wendish territories. The tangible assets of
-----File: 513.png---\KitFry\BabsP\VerenaM\JackieB\Scholar\----------------
the corporation were the harbor and fortified town of
J√≥msborg, together with the ships and other equipment
of such vikings as were admitted to fellowship; its intangible
assets were its franchise and the good-will of
the promoter and the underlying companies. Its by-laws
were very strict, both as to the discipline of the personnel
and as to the distribution of earnings. The promoter,
who was the first president of the corporation, was given
extreme powers for the enforcement of the by-laws, and
throughout his long incumbency of office he exercised
his powers with the greatest discretion and with a most
salutary effect.

This neutral, international corporation of piracy rapidly
won a great prestige. In modern phrase, its intangible
assets grew rapidly larger. Backed by the competitive
pressure which the new corporation was able
to bring upon the smaller companies and syndicates, this
prestige of the J√≥msvikings brought a steady run of applications
for admission into the trust. The trust's policy
was substantially the same as has since become familiar
in other lines of enterprise, with the difference that
in those early days the competitive struggle took a less
sophisticated form. Outstanding syndicates and private
firms were given the alternative of submission to the
trust's terms or retirement from the traffic. There was
great hardship among the outstanding concerns, especially
among that large proportion of them that were
unable to meet the scale of requirements imposed on applicants
for admission into the trust. The qualifications
both as to equipment and personnel were extremely strict,
so that a large percentage of the applicants were excluded;
and the unfortunates who failed of admission
found themselves in a doubtful position that grew more
precarious with every year that passed. Practically, such
-----File: 514.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\windymilla\JackieB\Scholar\------------
concerns were either frozen out of the business or forced
into a liquidation which permanently wound up their
affairs and terminated their corporate existence.

The accounts extant are of course not reliable in minute
details, being not strictly contemporary, nor are they cast
in such modern terms as would give an easy comparison
with present-day facts. The chief documents in the case
are <i>J√≥msvikingasaga</i>, <i>Saxo Grammaticus</i>, <i>Heimskringla</i>,
and <i>Olafssaga Tryggvasonar</i>; but nearly the whole of
the saga literature bears on the development of the viking
trade, and characteristic references to the J√≥msviking
trust occur throughout. The evidence afforded by these
accounts converges to the conclusion that toward the
close of the tenth century the trust stood in a high state
of prosperity and was in a position virtually to dictate
the course of the traffic for all that portion of the viking
trade that centered in the Baltic. Its prestige and influence
were strong wherever the traffic extended, even in
the region of the western isles and in the fjord country
of Norway. It had even come to be a factor of first-rate
consequence in international politics, and its power
was feared and courted by those two sovereigns who
established the Danish rule in England, as well as by
their Swedish, Norwegian, and Russian contemporaries.
It is probably not an overstatement to say that the Danish
conquest of England would not have been practicable except
for the alliance of the trust with Svend, which enabled
him to turn his attention from the complications of
Scandinavian politics to his English interests.

The extent of the trust's material equipment at the
height of its prosperity is a matter of surmise rather than
of statistical information. Some notion of its strength
may be gathered from the statement that the fortified
harbor of J√≥msborg included within its castellated sea-*

*wall an inclosed basin capable of floating three hundred
ships at anchor. In the great raid against the kingdom
of Norway, whose failure inaugurated the disintegration
of the trust, the number of ships sent out is variously
given by different authorities. The <i>J√≥msvikingasaga</i> says
that they numbered one long hundred. This fleet, however,
was made up of craft selected from among the ships
that were under the immediate command of four of the
great captains of adventure. The fleet, as it lay in the
Sound before the final selection, is said to have numbered
185, but the context shows that this fleet was but
a fraction of the aggregate J√≥msviking tonnage. Of this
disastrous expedition but a fraction returned; yet various
later expeditions of the J√≥msvikings are mentioned
in which some scores of their ships took part.

The trust having become an international power, it
undertook to shape the destiny of nations and dynasties,
and it broke under the strain. It, or its directors, took a
contract to bring Norway into subjection to the Danish
crown. Partly through untoward accidents, partly
through miscalculation and hurried preparations, it failed
in this undertaking, which brought the affairs of the trust
to a spectacular crisis. From this disaster it never recovered.
With the opening of the eleventh century the
viking trust fell into abeyance, and in a few years it
disappeared from the field. There are several good reasons
for its failure. On the death of its founder the
management had passed into the hands of Sigvaldi, a
man of less sagacity and less integrity as well as of more
unprincipled personal ambition, and somewhat given to
flighty ventures in the field of politics. It was Sigvaldi's
overweening personal ambition that committed the corporation
to the ill-advised expedition against Norway.
The trust, moreover, being supreme within its field, the
-----File: 516.png---\Pitirim\BabsP\windymilla\aagam\Scholar\--------------
discipline grew lax and its exactions grew arbitrary,
sometimes going to unprovoked excesses. As one might
say, too little thought was given to "economies of production,"
and the charges were pushed beyond "what
the traffic would bear." But for all that, in spite of its
meddling in politics, and in spite of jobbery and corruption
in its management, the trust still had a fair outlook
for continued success, except that the bottom dropped out
of the trade. For better or worse, the slave-trade in
the north of Europe collapsed on the introduction of
Christianity, at least so far as regards the trade in Christians;
and without a slave market the viking enterprise
had no chance of reasonable earnings. At the same time,
the risk and hardships of the traffic--the "cost of production"--grew
heavier as the countries to the south
became better able to defend their shores. The passenger
traffic failed almost entirely, and the goods traffic was in
a disorganised and unprofitable state. The costs were
fast becoming prohibitive, even to men so enterprising
and necessitous as the Norwegian freebooters. The situation
changed in such a way as to leave the trust out.

Some show of corporate existence was still maintained
for a short period after the trust's great crisis, but there
was an end of discipline and authoritative control. The
minor concerns and private establishments that had once
formed part of the trust continued in the trade on an independent
footing, but with decreasing regularity and
with diminishing strength. As the equipment wore out
it was not replaced, and the trade lapsed. The great captains
of the industry, like Sigvaldi, Thorkel Haraldson,
Sigurd K√°pa, and Vagn Akason, turned their holdings to
the service of the dynastic politics which were then engaging
the attention of the northern countries. Much of
this body of enterprise and wealth was exhausted in work-*

*ing out the imperialistic schemes of expansion of Svend
and Knut the Great; and what was left over shared the
fortunes of the other available forces of the Scandinavian
countries, being dissipated in political dissensions, extortionate
government organisations, and the establishment
of a church and a nobility.


THE END
