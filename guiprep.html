The included pngcrush.exe is a windows/dos compiled version of
pngcrush, a png file compression tool. It will losslesly reduce the
size of png files. Most image creation programs do not optimally
compress png files. Get the latest version of pngcrush.exe at <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1689">sourceforge</a>
(make sure you get the executable unless you are planning to compile it
yourself) or go the the <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/index.html">pngcrush
home page</a> for more information. The version included with the
script is the lowest common denominator version. If you have a MMX
capable processor, a faster, MMX enabled version is available.
Uncompress it and place it the pngcrush directory in the guiprep
folder. Make sure the included readme text file is named "README.txt"
so the help button can find it. Some distributions I have seen have the
help file named just "README"<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"> This script requires a perl
interpreter to run. The <a
 href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl">
ActiveState</a> perl interpreter is probably the most popular for
Windows users. (95, 98, 98se, ME, NT, 2K, XP) They are also have
versions available for Linux and Solaris. It's very functional and
free. (They do ask that you register, but you can bypass the
registration page without entering anything.) I personally would
recommend the 5.8.0 distribution. For Windows users, you use the
Microsoft Installer (MSI) version, it is very simple and automatic to
set up. If you don't have Microsoft Installer, a link is included on
the Activeperl download page.<br>

<br>
Given a set of rtf files output from an Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) program; this tool will extract text and italic and bold markup
from the .rtf files and save it as text, rejoin end-of-line hyphenated
words, filter out bad and undesirable characters, check for common
scannos* and check for zero byte files to help automate preparation of
files for <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/">Distributed Proofreaders</a>.
If your .png files are in a directory named PNGS, it can rename the
.png files into the upload format. It can also, if desired run a png
size optimizer on the files. You can queue up several projects and
process them in a batch. It provides a mechanism to semi automate
header removal and provides hooks to link in your favorite text editor
and image viewer to help check files. There is also a mini FTP client
built in that automates uploading a project to the site.<br>
<br>
*[A scanno is like a typo... only from a scanner instead of a typist.]<br>

<br>
<br>
The current  version now has a facility for removing the footers (last lines) as well as the headers of each page.<br><br>
The interactive search and replace now allows searches for regular expressions.<br><br>
To stop text getting too long and unwieldy, the changelog covering previous versions now has its own document, 
<a href="./changelog.html">changelog.html</a><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big><a name="#Known_bugs_and_odd_behavior:">Known Bugs</a><br></big>
</span>
<br>
<br>
Search and replace now allows regular expression.  Regular expressions in Search and replace will not work if searching for newlines ( \n in the expression).<br>
I <i>think</i> this is because the edit dialog box holds the current page as 
an array of strings, with no newline characters. If you want to search for a
pattern at the beginning of a line , use <b>^pattern</b>, for a pattern at the
end of a line, use <b>pattern$</b>.

<a name="Setting_up_the_text_files:"></a><big>Setting up the text files:</big><br>
</span><br>
There are two different dehyphenization routines. One works with a
single set of files, the files with line breaks preserved; the format
need by the Distributed Proofreaders site. The other will use two sets
of files, one set with line breaks and one set without. The two set
will yield better accuracy during dehyphenization at the expense of
slightly longer processing time and more disk storage space. To do two
set dehyphenization, save the text from ABBYY FineReader (or
possibly other OCR packages;
should work as long as they produce standard, well formed rtf files)
two times in two different directories. Assuming you have a project
directory named "PROJECT", under the project directory you will need
two directories "textw" and "textwo". "textw" stands for "text with
line breaks" and "textwo" stands for "text without line breaks". If you
are only going to do single set dehyphenization, you only need to
follow the instructions for the "textw" directory.<br>
<br>
<a name="with_RTF_Markup_Extraction:"></a>&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">with RTF Markup Extraction:</span><br>
<br>
In ABBYY after all of your images are loaded and OCRed, select File
=&gt; Save Text As;<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> &nbsp;<img
 style="width: 340px; height: 379px;" alt="menu" title=""
 src="pics/menu.png"> </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A dialog box will pop up.<br>
<br>
In the "textw" directory, save the text with the settings: Save as type
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rich text Format</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Create a separate file for each page</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Retain font and font size</span>. On
the RTF tab of the Formats Settings, check <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Keep page breaks</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Keep line breaks</span> and uncheck
everything else. It doesn't matter what the File name is set to. The
default is probably fine.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img
 style="width: 430px; height: 393px;" alt="text1" title=""

 alt="textw2" title="textw2" src="pics/textw2.png"> </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the "textwo" directory, save the text with the settings: Save as
type <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rich text Format</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Create a separate file for each page</span>,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Retain font and font size</span>. On the
RTF tab of the Formats Settings, check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep
page breaks</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Remove optional
hyphens</span> and uncheck everything else. Make sure the File name is
set the same as in the textw directory.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img
 style="width: 430px; height: 393px;" alt="textwo1" title=""

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><a
 name="without_RTF_Markup_Extraction:"></a>without</span> RTF Markup
Extraction:</span><br>
<br>
If you don't want to do markup extraction, (or your OCR package won't
support RTF files) you can skip saving the files as RTFs and just save
them as plain text files. Again, to do dehyphenization, you will need
to save the files in two directories, textw and textwo.<br>
<br>
Save the text with line breaks in textw. The ISO Latin-1 code page will
give you pretty good results for English and most European languages.
The site works with ISO Latin-1 so that may be least problematic to fit
into the character space used. Windows codepage 1252 should also work
well since it overlaps Latin1 very closely and where it doesn't, the
filter routine will convert characters that don't fall within Latin1.
This may actually yield better results than trying to force the OCR to
fit the text into the Latin1 character set.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img
 style="width: 783px; height: 396px;" alt="textw" title="textw"
 src="pics/txtw.png"> </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The textwo directory should use all of the same settings except that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Keep line breaks</span> needs to be
unchecked. Be sure to use the same code page and file names in both the
textw and textwo directories.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img
 style="width: 779px; height: 394px;" alt="textwo" title="textwo"
 src="pics/txtwo.png"> </div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point the script is used exactly the same way except you'll
skip the Extract Markup routine.<br>

&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">without</span>
RTF Markup Extraction <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span>
Dehyphenization:<br>
</span><br>
If you are using a different OCR package that can't save as rtf or do
automatic line rejoining, you may need to skip those two functions.
Save the files in a directory named "text" using the same settings as
for textw without RTF extraction above. Uncheck both Extract and
Dehyphenate under the Process Text tab. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"> <br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Using_the_script:"></a>
Using the script:</span></big><br>
<br>
When you run the script, a Graphical User Interface will pop up
allowing you to select options, select the working directory, and
process the text files. One implication of this is that the script no
longer NEEDS to run from the working directory. In fact, it will work
better if run you it from the same directory each time, changing to the
working directory after it starts, because it will save all of the
option settings in directory it is started in - in a file named
settings.rc, (rc is a standard extension for resource file), and it
will look for the scannos.rc file in the startup directory. The script
remembers the last directory you were working in and reopens to that
directory the next time you run it.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Select_Options_tab"></a>Select
Options tab</span></big><br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Select Options</span> tab will
allow you to adjust the markup used for italics and bold extraction and
set the options you want the filter routine to run. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Save Settings</span> button will save your
markup and selections from session to session. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Default Markup</span> button will change
all the markup text back to defaults. If there is little or no bold in
your text, you may want to disable bold extraction to cut down on false
positives. The other settings are all options for the filter routine.
See discussion below under Filtering for suggestions and explanations
for different settings.<br>
<br>
There are a few options having to do with batch processing.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract Bold Markup</span> - If you
don't have much bold text in your project you may want to diable this
to cut sdown on false positives, especially for lower quality scans.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Insert cell delimiters in tables</span>
- If you have tables in your project, the script will try to keep the
layout as much as it can. The cells usually will not come out exactly
as the origional, so youcan add markers "|", between the cells to help
the proofers align them .<big><br>
<br>
</big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract sub/superscript markup</span>
- Select whether to extract sub and super scriptws while doing mrkup
extraction.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dehyphenate using German style
hyphens; "="</span> - Option to dehyphenate German texts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Header Removal</span> - You can now
select whether you want to run automatic header removal on your text
files during batch processing. It will automatically remove the top
line from every text file. THIS MAY POSSIBLY REMOVE LINES THAT
SHOULDN'T BE REMOVED. USE WITH CARE. It is highly recommended that
header removal be done in interactive mode if feasible.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Build a zip of the project files</span>
- The site promises to soon have the capability to upload the project
files a a zip file. Possibly through a web interface rather than FTP.
This option will generate a zip archive containing all of the files in
the "text" and "pngs" directories. (or whatever you chose to name your
image directory) It will be written to the project directory with the
name of the project directory used as the name of the zip file.<br>

The "improbable character combination" filters (tli, rn, wli, hl, hr,
rnp, cb, gbh, [ai]hle) DEFINITELY should be run if you intend to run <span

*After ad hoc testing of about 50 texts pulled from PG at random,
solitary I is about 90 times more likely than solitary 1. If instances
at the beginning of lines are ignored, it rises to about 150 times.
Pretty good odds I think.<br>
<br>
*Solitary 0 (With nothing but space on either side) is automatically
converted to O. This is non negotiable. Because of the way the
dehyphenate subroutine works, if it encounters a solitary 0 in the
text, it will delete the rest of the paragraph. I would rather have a
few misconverted O's then deleted paragraphs. (It's not really the
dehyphenate subroutines fault, it's more just a consequence of perls
weak variable typing, but I digress.) This is not just my dehyphenate
routine, aldarondo's has the same problem but doesn't trap it.<br>
<br>
* &pound; to "Pounds" uses some intelligence when it converts. It will
move the "Pounds" to <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span>
the number. I.E. &pound;30 will become '30 Pounds' <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span> 'Pounds 30'<br>
<br>
* &cent; converts to "cents" unless it follows a solitary 1, in which
case it converts to "cent"<br>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 60%;"> <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Change_Directory_tab"></a>Change
Directory tab</span></big><br>
<br>
You can select the directory you want to work in in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Change Directory</span> tab. The top bar
shows what directory is the "current directory". In general, to run the
Extract and Dehyphen scripts you will need the "textw" and "textwo"
directories visible in the Change To selection box. The other text
processing routines need the text directory, which will be created by
the dehyphen routine, if necessary. The png processing routines will
need to see the pngs directory. Click on the directory name to move to
that directory or on the " .. " to move up one level. All of the
routines expect to run from the same directory. (The parent directory
of pngs, textw, textwo and [eventually] text.) If you want to run the
script in batch mode, select one or more directories containing the
files to be processed in the right hand box. All of the batch functions
work exactly like the interactive functions, they just allow you to
queue a bunch of projects up and process them all with one command.<br>
<br>
Remember, to do interactive processing you need to be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">IN</span> the project directory, for batch
processing you need to be <span style="font-style: italic;">ABOVE</span>
the project directory. Remove headers can only be done in interactive
mode, so you will need to be <span style="font-style: italic;">IN</span>
the project directory to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="height: 2px; width: 60%;"> <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Process_Text_tab"></a>Process Text
tab</span></big><br>
<br>
Once your options are set up and you are set to the right directory, go
to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Text</span> tab. In
this tab you can run the different routines on the text files. You can
run individual routines, mix and match or select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Do All Selected</span> to run all the
subroutines you select in one batch. Different routines have different
prerequisites so you can't necessarily run the routines out of order
and get good results.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract Markup</span> routine
expects to find the directory "textw" (and optionally "textwo" if you
are using the original dehyphenate routine) with rtf format files in
them. It will extract the text and markup and put the extracted files
in the same directory with a .txt extension.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dehyphenate</span> routine
expects to find the "textw" and optionally "textwo" directories with
.txt files in them. Whether the .txt are as a result of the Extract
routine or just .txt format files saved directly from Abby is
immaterial. It will put the merged files into a directory named "text",
creating it if it doesn't already exist. **WARNING: any files with a
.txt extension in the "text" when Dehyphenate runs WILL BE DELETED.
WITHOUT WARNING OR ASKING.**<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rename</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Correct Common Scannos</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Zero Byte</span> routines all expect to
find the "text" directory with .txt files in it. Again the files may be
from Dehyphen routine or may not.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rename Png Files</span> expects to
find the "pngs" directory with your .png files in it. It will rename
all of the .png files in the upload format.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Run Pngcrush</span> expects to find
the "pngs" directory with your .png files in it. It will run pngcrush
on each file to optimize the compression and reduce the size. The
default settings will change reduce the palette to the minimum
necessary. It <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> save the
original files in a directory " _pngsback_" so you can easily recover
them. If interrupted part way through, it will pick up where it left
off the next time you start it. As a consequence, if you interrupt it,
the pngs directory WILL NOT have all of the files in it. Make sure you
have the same number of text and png files before you upload them.<br>
<br>
If you are going to run both <span style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Common Scannos</span>, is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">highly</span> recommended that you run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span> first, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">then</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Common Scannos</span>. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Common Scannos</span> will check your
files for over 3000 of the most common mis-scanned English words and
correct them. It should be used with caution on non-english texts
though. It <span style="font-style: italic;">probably</span> won't
hurt but you should check a bunch of pages afterwords to be sure. (It
probably won't help either.)<br>
<br>
It is recommended that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Zero
Byte Files</span> routine be run last, though the order is not <span
 style="font-style: italic;">really</span> critical.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Convert to ISO-8859-1</span> NEEDS to
be run on files for the original DP site but SHOULD NOT be run on files
for DPEU.&nbsp; This will transliterate any Greek characters and
convert any other characters outside of Latin-1 to question marks.
Hopefully the original DP site will be converting to Unicode in the
near future and make this function unnecessary. <br>
<br>
In general, the routines should be run in top to bottom order. If you
run them by selecting the routines you want to run, then pressing <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Do All Selected</span>, they will
automatically run in the optimal order.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Processing</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Interrupt Processing</span> buttons will
start and stop processing job. If you have a batch queued up, it will
run the batch. Otherwise, it will run in interactive mode in the
current directory. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span>For batch processing, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start
Processing</span> will run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do All

and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Batch</span> will follow
your selections. If you <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>
want to, you can change options and selections <span
 style="font-style: italic;">while</span> the batch is in progress....
but you probably shouldn't. The small box in the lower left shows the

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 60%;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fix
Common Scannos:</span><br>
<br>
Guiprep uses a file named scannos.rc  for its word list. This is for English
language texts.  (there is also a list of common scannos in French, details on how to use that list are <a href="#frenchscanno"s>below</a><br><br>
The English scannos word list was pulled from the Distributed Proofreaders CVS
site. There are approximately 3400 words in the scannos list (though
the improbable letter combination filters make about 330 of them
redundant) &gt;From the description in the scannos list header:<br>
<br>
# Word list derived from Moby project data, cut for top 2000 frequency
and word<br>
# of 6 characters or less (to reduce size and assuming that longer
words will<br>
# be closely examined by the proofreaders). The resulting list was
processed<br>
# through perl scripts which generated scannos by replacement (see
below).<br>
# This result was then filtered to eliminate valid words from the
generated<br>
# "error" list (left side) to eliminate false positives.<br>
#<br>
# The common scannos from gutcheck and PRTK were then added, as well as
some<br>
# additional scannos provided by numerous DP proofreaders.<br>
#<br>
# The resulting list was then tested against just over 1 million words
of raw<br>
# OCR output provided by charlz. Further false positives were
discovered and<br>
# removed. The actual hit rate for this code is about 1 scanno detected
per 30k<br>
# words of input text. The actual accuracy rate against the corpus
provided by<br>
# charlz is: 2 false positives out of 122 scannos detected, or 98.3%
accurate.<br>
# Seems worthwhile to me. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
If you come up with misscanned word that you think should be in the
scanno list, let me know. Words that commonly are misscanned for each
other (like bad / had or and / arid) are NOT good additions. Those are
better off in Big_Bills' stealth scannos list.<br>
<br><br>
<a name"frenchscannos">French Scannos</a>
PGDP user lvl has contributed a similar file to the english list, this time 
generated by analysing changes made during proofing of 280 French language 
texts. This file is found in the same directory as scannos.rc; the French 
version is named scannos_fr.rc.  To use this rather than the English language 
list, rename scannos.rc to something else (perhaps scannos_en.rc), and 
rename scannos_fr to scannos.rc. Guiprep will then use the french language dile 


<hr style="height: 2px; width: 60%;"> <big style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Header_Removal_tab"></a>Header/Footer Removal tab</big><br>
<br>Often the top line of a page is a book or chapter title that will be removed
anyway: the bottom line sometimes also contains things you would like to remove, such as page numbers, book section letters, or, if using  third party provided page scans, such text as e.g "Digitized by Microsoft" This tool will help semi automate removing them. The procedure is similar for both removing page headers or footers. <span>
When all of the processing routines have been performed, you can go to
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Header/Footer Removal</span> tab to
delete the top lines and/or last lines of each text file, if desired. To do this in interactive mode, you will need to be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">IN</span> the project directory. If remove
headers is run in batch mode, it will automatically remove the top line
of EVERY text file (unless the top line is the blank page markup) and
then run the Fix Zero Byte Files routine to catch any emptied files.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get Headers</span>. This will load a list
of the first  lines of each file. Select the ones you want to delete
(probably easier to <span style="font-style: italic;">select all</span>,
then <span style="font-style: italic;">un</span>select the ones you <span
 style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> want to delete) then press <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Selected</span> to write the changes
to the affected files. <br>
For removing footers, the procedure is the same except you begin by pressing <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Get Footers</span>, which will display page footers for deletion.<br>
If you like, you can repeat selection/deletion to see if there
are any others you would like to remove. Repeat as necessary. If the
top line of a file is the blank page markup (from the select options
tab) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Headers</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">will not</span> delete it, you will have
to delete it manually if you want to remove it.<br>
If you accidentally remove lines you didn't intent to, will probably
be easiest to go back to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Text</span>
and run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dehyphenate</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rename,</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Common Scannos</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fix Zero Byte Files</span> again to
regenerate the files, then rerun <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove
Headers</span>. It would not be necessary to rerun <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Extract</span>, since those files are
stored in a different directory. Alternately, you may want to back up
your text files with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make Backups</span>
function on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process Text</span>
tab before you run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Headers/Footers</span>
so you can revert easily if problems arise.<br>
<br>
After you <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get Headers</span>, you can
easily edit the file that the header is part of by double left clicking
on the header to open your text editor. Set up your text editor on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Program Prefs</span> tab. If you <span
 style="font-style: italic;">DO</span> edit some of the files this way,
remember to refresh the header list before running <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Selected</span>. You can also link
an image viewer so you can compare image and text side by side (Much
like the site! :-) ) <a href="http://www.irfanview.com">Irfanview</a>
works really well for this. And it's free! <a
 href="http://www.xnview.com/">XnView</a> is another great free image
viewer that works well. Invoke your image viewer by left then right
clicking on a file header. **<span style="font-style: italic;">Will not
work in Winprep.exe</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Winprep
cannot run external programs</span>.**<br>
<br>
&nbsp;If you use <a href="http://www.irfanview.com">Irfanview</a>, for
best results, set View-&gt;Display options to 'Fit only big images to
window'.<br>
<br>
If you use <a href="http://www.xnview.com/">XnView</a>, it's a little
more complex. Go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;View and check 'Maximize view
when open' and set 'Auto image size' to 'Fit image to window, large
only.' Go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Misc and check 'Remember last
position/size'<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">*Caveat*</span> There is a bug in the
command line parsing in <a href="http://www.xnview.com/">XnView</a>.
If you have a directory with a space in the name, in the path to XnView
(like 'Program Files' for instance), it will fail with a 'File not
found' error. As long as there are no directories with spaces in the
name in the path, it will work fine. <a href="http://www.irfanview.com">Irfanview</a>
and other image viewers I have tested don't have this problem.<br>

<hr style="height: 2px; width: 60%;"> <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Search_tab"></a>Search tab</span></big><br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> tab has search and
replace functions that will search through the text files and display
the files with the search term and allow you to modify them, if
desired. This is a strictly interactive tab. It is handy to check for
project specific scanning errors or to check up on synchronization
errors during dehyphenization. (Search for '**') Maybe after you've
done all your processing, you decide that you shouldn't have done bold
extraction after all. Just do a search and replace on &lt;b&gt; and
&lt;/b&gt;.<br>
There are some options to do case insensitive searching or search for
whole words only to narrow down what the search function will find.  
You can also select to search for a regular expression. 
<b>NOTE:</b>
Selecting regular expression will override whole word and case insensitive 
searches. Regular expressions work like standard Perl expressions with 
one exception: the escape character for a new line, \n, will not work. 
Use ^ for the start of a line, $ for the end of a line instead. 
<a href="#Known_bugs_and_odd_behavior:">Known Bugs</a> for more detail. <br>
When you perform a search, if the search text is found, the whole file
it is in will be displayed in the text window with the found text
highlighted and the cursor just before it.<br>
 If the search text is not
found in any of the remaining files, a dialog will pop up informing you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The buttons are pretty self explanatory. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Save Open File</span> button saves the text
that is currently displayed in the window to the file, overwriting the
original. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> looks for the
next occurrence of the search term. If you already have a text file
open and press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span>, it will
proceed with the search starting from the open file. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Replace</span> substitutes the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Replacement Text</span> for the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Search Text</span> in the window, and saves
the file. To cancel an in progress search, change the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Search Text</span>, that will reset the
file index counter to the beginning. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace
&amp; Search</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold;">R &amp; S</span>)
just combines the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> buttons into one function
call. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace All</span> will call <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Replace</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> until all of the files have
been searched. It will reset the file index counter to zero before it
starts so if you are performing a manual search, get halfway through
the files and then press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace All</span>,
it will start over again at the first file.<br>
<br>

There is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program Prefs</span> tab
where you can set some preferences which affect how the program looks
and runs. You can change the color palette the the script uses, you can
associate a text editor with the script to allow easy checking and
editing of files while you are doing header removal and you can
associate an image viewer to do side-by-side comparisons with text.<br>
<br>
The default palette is CornSilk2. I also like PeachPuff2, Bisque2,
CadetBlue3 and Ivory3. Some truly painful ones are chartruse1,
IndianRed1, brown1 and DarkOrchid2. Ouch!<br>
<br>
You can now specify what the name of the directory containing your png
files is on this tab. Default is 'pngs'. Avoid using directory names
with spaces in them.<br>
<br>
For Windows users, you will probably want to use wordpad or notepad or

host.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Listing</span> (Text Readout) -
List of files that will be uploaded when Send Files is pressed.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Listing</span> (Text Readout) -
A listing of all of the files and directories in the current directory
on the remote host.<br>
<br>
The directory listing shows files prefixed by 'FILE - ' with the byte
size after. Directories are prefixed by 'DIR -&nbsp; ' (except the
double dot entry ".." which is short hand for "parent directory").<br>
<br>
To <span style="font-weight: bold;">Change Directories</span> on the
remote host, double left click on a directory name in the remote
directory listing.<br>
<br>
To <span style="font-weight: bold;">Download</span> a file or
directory, left click then right click on it.(Or just double left click
a file name) A dialog will pop up to select a download directory. When
downloading multiple single files, don't try to start the next before
the previous one is finished. It will cause problems with the script.<br>
<br>
When downloading a directory, the script will make a directory with the
same name as the remote directory that it is downloading in the local
directory that you choose through the download dialog.<br>
The directory download dialog may be somewhat confusing. Double left
click on a directory name or drive name to change to it, or on ".." to
go up one directory. When the target directory (where you want the new
directory to be placed) is in the text box below, press OK to start the
download. The script will create the new directory, if necessary, and
download the files into it, overwriting without warning any same name
files that may already be in it.<br>
At the bottom of the dialog there is a filename filter box. By default,
(filter left blank, equivalent to '.' [any character]) all of the files
in the selected remote directory will be downloaded. If you only want
the text files, put <span style="font-weight: bold;">.txt</span> in
the filter box. If you only want the PNG files put <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.png</span>. If you put a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2</span> in the filter box, you'll get all
of the files that have a 2 in the name. (002.txt, 002.png, 012.txt,
012.png, 020.txt, 020.png.... etc.) It uses perl regular expressions to
evaluate the pattern so you can build a much more complex matching
filter if desired.<br>
<br>
To interrupt a batch download or upload in progress, press <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Stop Transfer</span>. This will stop the
batch transfer after the current file is finished. To stop immediately,
press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disconnect</span>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> a file or directory,
select it (left click) then press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span>.<br>
Directories do not need to be empty to be deleted. A dialog will pop up
to ask for confirmation.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MAKE SURE YOU <span
 style="font-style: italic;">REALLY</span> WANT TO DO THIS. IT CAN <span
 style="font-style: italic;">NOT</span> BE UNDONE.<br>
<br>
</span>You can view files in the local list (if they are text or image
files) by double left clicking on them.<br>
<br>
You can remove one or several files from the local list by highlighting
the file name(s) then double right clicking, or clear the list with the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear File List</span> push button.<br>
<br>
For files in the local list, double click on a file name to view it (if
it is a text or image file).<br>
<br>
Select one or more file names and double right click to remove the
names from the list.<br>
<br>
The script does directory caching to drastically speed up walking the
tree. It does not save the cache when you close the program.<br>

From an analysis of changes in proofing of 280 projects, PGDP user lvl has produced a file of scannos suitable for French texts. It is included this directory as the file <b>scannos_fr.rc</b>.  To use it, rename the sscannos.rc file to scannos_en.rc , then rename scannos_fr to scannos.en

<br>
The script tries to figure out whether it can run the way it expects
and tries to warn you if it has a problem.<br>
<br>
If it warns that it can't find files or a directory, you probably
selected the wrong directory as a working directory or you may being
running in the wrong mode, (batch instead of interactive or vice versa)
or possibly you have incorrect options selected. (Running extract when
you don't have rtf files.) Remember, for interactive mode, the textw
and textwo directories (and possibly text and pngs) should be visible
in the change directory box. For batch mode, you need to select the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">parent</span> directory of the textw and
textwo directories.<br>
<br>
Warnings about the scannos file are a result of a missing or corrupted
scannos.rc file. If you edit the file, be sure to follow the format
shown.<br>
<br>
One thing that will produce odd results is to feed the script RTF files
that contain 16 bit characters. (Unicode or UTF-8) It is really
designed to work with 8 bit characters using code page Windows 1252 or
ISO Latin-1. If you end up with page after page of question marks, you
probably are saving your RTF files as 16 bit characters.<br>
<br>
If you somehow get the window set larger than your desktop and can't
get to an edge to resize it, delete the settings.rc file in the startup
directory. That will reset all of the settings to defaults, which will
reduce the window to 640x480 pixels. Alternately, you can edit the
settings.rc file with a text editor and remove the line that starts:
$geometry = .<br>

<br>
When viewing a file through the Headers tab, you may have an unexpected
or wrong file open up. Due to the way list boxes are handled under Tk,
you need to specifically select (left click) an entry before you can
act on it (right click). If you haven't selected an entry, either the
last entry in the list or the previous selection is defaulted to. The
actual mouse pointer position is ignored on right click.<br>
<br>
Customized open and close markup markers are not sanity checked. The
script will not check or care if you use inappropriate markers. For
instance you can set both italics and bold to use the same markup, or,
even worse, use a marker which will occur normally in the text. If you
specify "the" and "and" or even "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " for your
italics open and close markers, the script will uncomplainingly use
them. Probably not a good idea.<br>
<br>
If you switch away from the Process text tab while a batch or job is
running, it will automatically cancel the job to prevent contamination
of other directories. Each tab has its own peculiarities about where it
needs to run and if you try to switch to one while another is
processing, it could cause problems.<br>
<br>
The FTP client blocks while it is waiting for a response from the FTP
server. It appears that the program has locked up but it is just
waiting for something to happen. If the connection is lost, it will
return immediately. On a dial-up connection, for large transfers, (the
initial directory listing, for instance) it can take between 30 - 60
seconds to respond. Be patient. It <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
working.<br>
