Upgrading to a new Guiguts version.

1. Download latest version: https://sourceforge.net/projects/guiguts/

2. Unzip in preferred location, e.g. /home/you/DP, C:\DP

3. Creates directory guiguts-VERSION.

4. Open new and old GG directories in separate file browser windows.

5. a: Copy any custom files from old to new GG directory; heading.txt,
    wordlist, scannos, setting.rc etc.

   b: Unixy folks can do above in a command terminal: 
            cd OLD-GG/; cp -i header.txt setting.rc NEW-GG/

6. Fire up GG and have fun PPing.

Some notes:

New GG versions are packaged with gutcheck, jeebies, and tidy (no tidy for Unix-types). Moving a setting.rc is still pointing at the old GG directory.

Since gutcheck, etc. are fairly static as far as releases go, one setup is copy gutcheck, jeebies, tidy directories outside the GG directories.

Example directory setup:

        DP
         guiguts-OLD
         guiguts-NEW
         gutcheck
         jeebies
         tidy

Use the Prefs/Set File Paths menu item to point to the utilities. This way you can move the settings.rc without having to fiddle with re-setting the locations for new upgrades. Delete the gc, jeebies, tidy from the GG directory if so inclined.

An alternative upgrade path is copy the new guiguts.pl (might rename so not to overwrite the old GG.pl) to old GG directory. Copy the GG/lib directory into old, overwriting files in that directory. It's important that the lib directory is moved over to catch any upgrades/enhancements provided by files contained there.
